Latest Information and Changes

THE SETTLERS III (r) - GOLD EDITION(tm)
==============================================


Troubleshooting
=====================================

Problems with Debuggers and System Monitoring Tools
===================================================

Please note that The Settlers 3 - Quest of the Amazons may not run correctly, if one or more programs run simultaneously, which manipulate Windows' system processes. Among those programs are debuggers and system monitoring tools, such as McAfee's FirstAid. If you encounter any problems starting The Settlers 3 - Quest of the Amazons please quit all those programs. In some cases it may even be necessary to completely de-install the program in question (i.e. McAfee's FirstAid).


Voodoo 3 Graphics Adaptors
==========================

Make sure that you have the most recent driver for your Voodoo 3 graphics
adaptor (2000, 3000 and 3500) installed. The driver must not be older than the Voodoo 3 Windows 9x Retail Driver Version 1.02.11 or Voodoo 3 Windows NT Retail Driver Version 1.02.10. You can download the latest Voodoo 3 driver from the following URL:
http://www.3dfxgamers.com .

Settlers 3 Level Editor V2.0 and Windows 95 A
=============================================

Please note that the new Level Editor V2.0 does NOT work under Windows 95 A.
Users of this Windows release should update to Windows 95B.

Settlers 3 Level Editor: Memory Issues with "View Map In Game"
=============================================================
The editor function "View Map In Game" requires a lot of memory, because both the editor and the game have to run simultaneously.
On systems with little memory (or on systems with hardly any virtual memory
left) this may cause warnings and error messages.
In this case you should load a map in the game manually after closing the
editor first. This is also recommended for systems with slow CPUs.

Victory Conditions Cannot Be Configured Or the Corresponding Menu Item Is Grayed Out.
=============================
If the menu item "Victory Conditions" cannot be selected, the map being edited has been defined as a multiplayer map.

Solution: Select the option "Single player" in the menu "General Map Settings" (Edit, Edit Map Settings...).

If the menu item can be selected but no window opens, this often can be traced back to the file, comctl32.dll, which exists in several versions and offers increased functionality with each newer version. This library is a part of the Microsoft operating systems Windows 95, 98, and NT 4 as well as the Microsoft Internet Explorer.

For the Victory Conditions, the editor uses a function which exists only in more recent versions of this library file. This problem will only occur among the few users who have an older version of this file installed. Once you have installed Windows 98, the Internet Explorer 4.0 or 5.0, a new Windows NT service pack 4, a recent Office version or similar products from Microsoft on your system, this file will automatically be replaced by a newer version and this problem will no longer occur.

The newest version of this file, which is suitable for all users of Windows 95, 98, and NT 4(but not for Alpha computers)can also be downloaded from Microsoft's Internet pages at http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/ieplatform/ie/comctrlx86.asp

Level Editor Compatibility
==========================
Please note that the Level Editor v. 2.0 is compatible with all maps which have been created with the Level Editor v. 1.0 (present on the Settlers III Mission CD). 
The Level Editor v. 1.0 can also be used with all maps that have been created with the Level Editor v. 2.0 provided that NO Amazons or Amazon objects are included on the map!


Saving Multiplayer-Games
========================
1.) For each multiplayer game, 1 saved-game file will be put on the hard disk of the players participating in the game. During the game this file will be successively overwritten. When you begin another game, a new saved-game file will be created. If you play a very large map (the large random maps, for example), these files can get very large (up to ca. 13 MB). Make sure that you have enough space free on your hard disk.

2.) When a computer of one of the players cannot save the game and therefore is thrown out, the game will be saved on the computers of the remaining players (though there may be a longer pause). With the exception of the player whose computer was not able to save the game, all the remaining players can continue play and also load the saved game later. 
Possible causes for problems while saving could, for example, include:

-insufficient hard disk space (both for the saved game itself as well as for
virtual memory for Windows)
-a defective hard disk or one with cluster errors.

3.)  A game begun on a LAN can be continued in the Internet or vice versa.

Message "out of memory"
=======================
If you get a message reporting that your system has run out of memory, please check whether enough free space for your swap file is available on your hard disk (drive C: in most cases)

Intellimouse(r)
===============
Windows Explorer Error Message:
On some machines with the Microsoft(r) Intellimouse(r) wheel mouse an Explorer error might occur when starting THE SETTLERS III. Our current understanding is that this is an incompatibility between IntelliPoint 2.2 (the wheel mouse software) and DirectX 6. The error message will disappear if you uninstall IntelliPoint (thus removing the wheel features).

- Multiplayer Gamesave:
Saving multiplayer games was one of the most requested features from gamers. Here it is. Each player can save the game by clicking on the computer symbol in the lower left-hand corner of the screen and then on Save. The game will then be saved on the computers of all the players so that if the game is ended before one player emerges victorious, the game can be later initiated by any of the players in the SETTLERS III Lobby.
If one of the players is not available to continue the game, this player can be replaced by a computer player.
It isn't possible, however, for a human player to take over from a computer player.
IMPORTANT:
You can't load a saved multiplayer game from the "Load Game" button! You'll find your saved game in the same place where you choose other net games from the lobby. Click on "Saved Multiplayer".
You won't be asked to name the game when you save it. You won't have to choose a save location either. The game will be saved in the directory "Save/Multi".
A display in the chat line shows all of the players in the game the name of the player who has saved the game. There must be at least a minute's interval between saving games.
A saved game is initiated just like any other net game. In the lobby, click on "Create Game" and then choose the saved game you want to begin under "Saved Multiplayer". Saved games are listed there. When you click on one of them, the name of the map, the time at which you saved the game and a list of the players in the game will be displayed where you normally see the preview map. Confirm your choice with "OK" and you'll automatically return to the meeting point where you can wait for the other players in the game. 
- Automatic Saved Games in the Campaigns
When you've completed a map in the campaign, have read the end-of-the-game statistics and have clicked with your mouse, the mission briefing for the next map appears. When you then click on "Return", the program now recognizes that you've completed the previous map and have begun with a new one.
You can load these saved games from the main menu by clicking on "Load Game". In the menu which then appears on the right, click on "Campaigns". A list will appear in which all of the campaign missions wheich you have begun are listed. Click on the mission which you most recently discontinued.
All of the missions of the original campaigns have been made available under the assumption that you've already successfully completed them.
