<p><font face="Arial" size="2">THE SETTLERS III Editor enables you to create your own new
single and multi-player maps for THE SETTLERS III. It doesn't allow you to alter maps that
have already been designed, such as the maps for the original campaigns or the single or
multi-player maps created by Blue Byte.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">THE SETTLERS III Level Editor offers you two formats for
saving maps that you have created or are in the process of creating. The first format has
the extension </font><font color="#5A5A5A" face="Courier" size="3"><b>.edm</b></font><font
face="Arial" size="2">. This format is the one you want to use as long as you are still in
the process of designing your map or if you wish to save a partially finished map as a
template map for future variations. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Say, for example, that you want to create a series of maps
based on the concept of &quot;The Settlers go to Florida&quot;. The Level Editor allows
you to create an island into the shape of the of Florida, lavish it with appropriately
beautiful beaches and palm trees, and even create an otherwise non-existent mountain range
if you like. A little imagination, several variations on the initial starting locations or
the amounts of resources available for your settlers can really enhance the replayability
of THE SETTLERS III. By changing the weighting of magic or military strengths, you could
effectively create an experience that even THE SETTLERS III designers never thought of. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The second format that your SETTLERS III Level Editor
offers you has the extension </font><font color="#5A5A5A" face="Courier" size="3"><b>.map</b></font><font
face="Arial" size="2">. This is the format you want to use when you are satisfied with the
map you have created and wish to save it so that no further changes can be made. When you
save your map in this format, the map can no longer be opened with the map editor and thus
can no longer be changed. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">After you have created your map, you'll of course want to
play it and offer others the same possibility. Here again, it is very important to keep in
mind the differences between the two formats. The .edm format should only be given to
others when you want to work cooperatively on the creation of a new map or a series of
maps. For multiplayer play, it is essential that the </font><font color="#5A5A5A"
face="Courier" size="3"><b>.map</b></font><font face="Arial" size="2"> format is used and
that the maps are identical. If players in a multiplayer game use maps with the same name
which are not identical, this will lead to quirky behavior in the game and to system
crashes!</font></p>

</b>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The term <strong>terrain</strong> is meant to include all
forms of land and water, as well as elevation for hills and mountains, and depths for seas
and lakes. All forms of the terrain, including grass, desert, swamps, and rivers can be
found in the Tool Window under &quot;<font color="#5A5A5A"><strong>Set Type of Terrain</strong></font>&quot;.
You will also find the tools for elevating the land or setting depth for water here as
well.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The term <strong>Object</strong> is meant to include trees,
stone, graves, buildings, goods piles, and even Settlers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The term <strong>Raw Materials</strong> is meant to include
mining products such as gold and iron, as well as fish.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><img src="../../images/english/win/werkausw.gif"
align="left" border="0" hspace="10" vspace="5" WIDTH="189" HEIGHT="201">All forms of
terrain, objects and raw materials are placed on the map via the Design Window using your
mouse. Please note - where you place things on your map is subject to certain
restrictions. For example, you may only place mineral resources under rocky terrain. To do
this, click in the &quot;<font color="#5A5A5A"><strong>Tool Window</strong></font>&quot;
on the terrain, object, or type of material you want to use, choose from the &quot;<font
color="#5A5A5A"><strong>Tool Setup Window</strong></font>&quot; the type of brush you want
to use, and place it or paint it in your map in the Design Area.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">It is strongly recommended that you proceed in the order
described above. First, create your terrain and set its elevation; then place your objects
on the terrain, and finally place the raw materials in your map. In the section, &quot;<strong><a
href="../werkausw/werkausw.htm">A Closer Look at the Tool Window</a></strong>&quot;,
you'll find detailed information about restrictions on placing the different types of
objects and raw materials on various kinds of terrain.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">To replace one form of terrain with another, you simply
&quot;paint&quot; over the existing terrain. Note - if you &quot;paint&quot; water on
terrain that you've elevated (hilly or mountainous terrain), the elevation will be dropped
back to zero or sea level.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Under certain circumstances the Level Editor won't allow
you to place certain buildings or settlers where you want. For example, you cannot place
raw materials in a desert, or fish in swamps. You'll find more information about this in
the sections &quot;<font color="#5A5A5A"><strong>Setting Buildings</strong></font>&quot;
and &quot;<font color="#5A5A5A"><strong>Setting Settlers</strong></font>&quot;. When a
building or settler cannot be placed in a certain terrain, it will be appear grayed-out.
When an object or raw material is placed over terrain where it is allowable, it will be
displayed in its normal color. </font></p>

</b>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Whereas you can <strong>place</strong> objects on the map
by simply clicking with the map, when you <strong>delete</strong> objects, you have to
specify which object you want to delete beforehand. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">For this you have the following buttons or items:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the Tool Window you'll find an item in every
subdirectory that contains objects designated &quot;</font><strong><font color="#5A5A5A"
face="Arial" size="2">Delete </font><font face="Courier" color="#5A5A5A" size="3">&lt;Object
name&gt;</font></strong><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;. When this item is selected,
you can delete the corresponding objects by simply clicking on them. It is also possible
to select an object from this group and then while holding the &quot;<font color="#5A5A5A"><strong>Ctrl</strong></font>&quot;
key depressed, click on the object on the map.The object will then be deleted.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">When you select &quot;</font><strong><font color="#5A5A5A"
face="Arial" size="2">Delete </font><font face="Courier" color="#5A5A5A" size="3">&lt;Object
name&gt;</font></strong><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot; and at the same time hold the
&quot;<font color="#5A5A5A"><strong>Shift</strong></font>&quot; key down, all objects and
settlers under your mouse pointer will be deleted. This doesn't apply to buildings and raw
materials.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The same thing happens when you activate the item &quot;<font
color="#5A5A5A"><strong>Delete All</strong></font>&quot; in the Tool Window.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">In general, there are objects which can be placed and
deleted with brushes of various sizes. A forest, for example, can be placed on the map or
deleted with a bold brush.. But, on the other hand, there are objects which are not so
well suited for mass placement or mass deletion. There is no need for painting 20
woodcutter's huts onto the map at one stroke. A list follows indicating which objects can
be placed and deleted with different sized brushes and which objects cannot be placed or
deleted in this way.</font></p>
