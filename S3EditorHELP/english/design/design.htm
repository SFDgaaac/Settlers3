<p><font face="Arial">After you've looked at your map, use the &quot;<font color="#5A5A5A"><strong>Esc</strong></font>&quot;
key to return to the Level Editor so that you can continue working on your map.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">In order to create such a natural looking coastline, you only need
the right settings for your tools and a little patience. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">To begin with, change to zoom level 4 focusing in on a piece of your
coastline. Go to the &quot;<font color="#5A5A5A"><strong>Tool Window</strong></font>&quot;
and choose &quot;<font color="#5A5A5A"><strong>Grass</strong></font>&quot; once again,
this time choosing &quot;<font color="#5A5A5A"><strong>Thin</strong></font>&quot; as your
brush size. In addition, activate the &quot;<font color="#5A5A5A"><strong>Sprinkle</strong></font>&quot;
function. Glide along the coastline being careful to avoid long, straight edges. With a
little practice, you'll soon develop a feeling for doing this. This same procedure can be
used not only for borders between water and shore, but also for the borders between the
shoreline and grassland.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">You can repeat this process using &quot;<font color="#5A5A5A"><strong>Point</strong></font>&quot;
instead of &quot;<font color="#5A5A5A"><strong>Thin</strong></font>&quot; to roughen up
the last straight stretches.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">As the final step, please change the selected terrain from grass to
shore. Leave your brush size at &quot;<font color="#5A5A5A"><strong>Point</strong></font>&quot;
and move along the perimeter of your entire island at zoom level 4 so that you can be sure
of not missing any straight edges.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Check your results in the game once more, in the same way you did
before. Remember to press the &quot;<strong>Esc</strong>&quot; key to return to the Level
Editor. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">If any places are not yet up to expectations, continue improving
them until you're satisfied with the results. There is another possibility of roughening
up the borders. Instead of using grass as your point of departure, you can also choose
water. Open the subdirectory for &quot;<font color="#5A5A5A"><strong>Water</strong></font>&quot;,
clicking on the &quot;<font color="#5A5A5A"><strong>+</strong></font>&quot; sign and then
choose &quot;<font color="#5A5A5A"><strong>Water Level 1</strong></font>&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Choose &quot;<font color="#5A5A5A"><strong>Thin</strong></font>&quot;
as your brush size with &quot;<font color="#5A5A5A"><strong>Sprinkle</strong></font>&quot;
activated, just as you did with &quot;<font color="#5A5A5A"><strong>Grass</strong></font>&quot;.
Of course, you can effectively use these settings for all types of terrain when you want
to roughen up the border.</font></font></p>

between the rocky terrain and the grassland with a Thin Grass Sprinkle. </font></p>

mountains look the way you imagined them? If they are not quite up to par, go back and
make improvements where necessary. Here again, you'll develop a feeling for this quickly.</font></p>

        far away from both players. The Roman player should be informed as well that it is in his

        region of the main landmass in the middle of the map.</font></li>

<p><font face="Arial">Having reached this point in the design of the map, you can well
imagine that it could become even more interesting by building in a couple more challenges
for the player. In the map we can see that the gem deposits in the northeast of the main
land mass is easy for the Romans to reach. The Romans shouldn't have any real difficulties
in depriving the Asians of access to these important deposits. As soon as the Romans take
over this area, the Egyptian player (Computer) will have little chance of getting to the
gem deposits.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">There is a simple possibility for changing the area so that it's
more difficult for the Romans to settle, but gives the Egyptians a fighting chance: a
desert.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Go to the &quot;<font color="#5A5A5A"><strong>Tool Window</strong></font>&quot;

the &quot;<font color="#5A5A5A"><strong>Tool Setup</strong></font>&quot; Window, please
adjust your brush to &quot;<font color="#5A5A5A"><strong>Medium</strong></font>&quot; and
make sure that that the &quot;<font color="#5A5A5A"><strong>Sprinkle</strong></font>&quot;
