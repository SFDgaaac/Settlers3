sources of errors and a set of necessary conditions before the file is saved or exported.

    <font size="2" face="Arial">You are not required to provide a description for your map but

    that players can at least build a forester's hut, a woodcutter's hut and a sawmill, the
    map is playable. No trees make for a very barren landscape, though.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#800000" size="3" face="Verdana"><strong>There is no building stone on the

    <font size="2" face="Arial">If you have hidden piles of building stone throughout the map,
    it will be playable. If you haven't done this, players won't be able to build anything,

<ul>
  <li><font color="#800000" size="3" face="Verdana"><strong>There are no resources on the map;
    your miners have nothing to do and your fisherman has no fish to catch.</strong></font><br>
    <font size="2" face="Arial">This map is playable if you have hidden piles of resources

<ul>
  <li><strong><font color="#800000" size="3" face="Verdana">There are fewer <i>Settlers /

    </font><font size="2" face="Arial">These warning messages are displayed only after at

    reason for deviating from the minimal recommended levels.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;A couple short explanations follow concerning what
can happen when not enough tools or Settlers are available.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font color="#800000" size="3" face="Arial"><strong><a name="_Toc444935513">Hammers/Smelters/Builders</a><br>
</strong></font><font color="#800000" size="4" face="Arial"><b><img
src="../../images/line_h.gif" width="100%" height="6"></b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">This warning appears when you have placed fewer than the
recommended number of hammers, smelters or builders. Smelters and builders need hammers.
If you have too few of them, there can be no new builders or smelters. This could lead to
a bottleneck in later phases of weapon production or even in the first building projects.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Please also keep in mind that, after you've built a
residence, a certain percentage of the new Settlers will become builders and that they
need hammers. If you don't have a smelter by then, your game could easily lead to a dead
end. If you don't need any further builders, you can adjust this in the game.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font color="#800000" size="3" face="Arial"><strong><a name="_Toc444935514">Scythes/Farmers</a><br>
</strong></font><font color="#800000" size="4" face="Arial"><b><img
src="../../images/line_h.gif" width="100%" height="6"></b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Place at least one scythe on the map because players will
need food for their miners. Without mines and in turn without metal, the tool smith cannot
produce scythes.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font color="#800000" size="3" face="Arial"><strong><a name="_Toc444935515">Picks/Miners</a><br>
</strong></font><font color="#800000" size="4" face="Arial"><b><img
src="../../images/line_h.gif" width="100%" height="6"></b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If you have too few picks, they may all be alloted to the
stonecutters before you have any miners. Without picks the player won't have any miners
for his mines. Make sure you have enough picks and at least two miners.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font color="#800000" size="3" face="Arial"><strong><a name="_Toc444935516">Swordsmen</a><br>
</strong></font><font color="#800000" size="4" face="Arial"><b><img
src="../../images/line_h.gif" width="100%" height="6"></b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If you have too few swordsmen, new guard towers cannot be
garrisoned and the expansion of the colony will draw to a halt..</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font color="#800000" size="3" face="Arial"><strong><a name="_Toc444935517">Carriers</a><br>
</strong></font><font color="#800000" size="4" face="Arial"><b><img
src="../../images/line_h.gif" width="100%" height="6"></b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If you have too few carriers, your economy slows to a
snail's pace. The more carriers you have, the faster goods can be distributed.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font color="#800000" size="3" face="Arial"><strong><a name="_Toc444935518">Shovels/Diggers</a><br>
</strong></font><font color="#800000" size="4" face="Arial"><b><img
src="../../images/line_h.gif" width="100%" height="6"></b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If too few shovels and/or diggers are available,
construction takes considerably longer. Without any shovel and diggers, the settlers won't
be able to build unless you already have a tool smith who can produce shovels.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font color="#800000" size="3" face="Arial"><strong><a name="_Toc444935519">Wood/Stone</a><br>
</strong></font><font color="#800000" size="4" face="Arial"><b><img
src="../../images/line_h.gif" width="100%" height="6"></b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">So that you can get started building without delay, you
need boards and stones from the very beginning. You could, of course, want a delay for
strategic reasons, but make sure that building is possible.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font color="#800000" size="3" face="Arial"><strong><a name="_Toc444935520">Woodcutters/Sawmill
Workers/Stonecutters</a><br>
</strong></font><font color="#800000" size="4" face="Arial"><b><img
src="../../images/line_h.gif" width="100%" height="6"></b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">To avoid delays, you need production capacity for building
materials. If you intend to have delays, be sure that construction is possible.</font></p>
