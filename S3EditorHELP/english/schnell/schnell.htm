<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Here is information for those of you who want to jump right
in making your own maps and levels. Working with the Level Editor and trying out the
different functions is sometimes the best way to learn. There are a couple things to watch
out for though:</font> 

<dir>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">You can only set the size of a map once, and that is when
    you create it. Subsequent changes to the size are no longer possible.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Under &quot;</font><font color="#5A5A5A" size="2"
    face="Arial"><strong>Map Settings</strong></font><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot; in the
    &quot;</font><font color="#5A5A5A" size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Edit</strong></font><font
    size="2" face="Arial">&quot; menu, you choose whether you want to create a single or
    multiplayer map. This setting can be changed later.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">You can view a map that you are currently working on within
    the game without any problems. To do so, click on &quot;</font><font color="#5A5A5A"
    size="2" face="Arial"><strong>View Map in Game</strong></font><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;
    in the &quot;</font><font color="#5A5A5A" size="2" face="Arial"><strong>File</strong></font><font
    size="2" face="Arial">&quot; menu.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">To view a map in the game, you have to save it first. If it
    is a multiplayer map, you should name your map so that it contains the numbers of players
    it is designed for. &quot;</font><font color="#5A5A5A" size="2" face="Arial"><strong>5x2P_HC.edm</strong></font><font
    size="2" face="Arial">&quot;, for example, would indicate that the map is designed for
    five parties, each consisting one human player and one computer player. This serves as a
    helpful orientation for potential players. No limits are set to your imagination with
    regard to naming single player maps.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">When you edit buildings or Settlers, it is very important
    that you have the correct player activated for the buildings or settlers you want to edit.
    The player can be selected at the bottom of the &quot;</font><font color="#5A5A5A"
    size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Tool Setup Window</strong></font><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">As soon as you've placed just one guard tower on your map,
    you have to do this for all players because the Level Editor will then no longer assign
    the initial goods piles.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Buildings can only be placed on territory that the active
    player controls. As in the game, guard towers and castles determine control of the
    territory. </font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">The Level Editor distinguishes between these different types
    of information: terrain, elevation, buildings, settlers, landscape objects, resources and
    goods piles.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">You cannot put all objects, buildings, and Settlers on every
    kind of terrain. You cannot, for example, put cactuses in snow, or build a fisherman's hut
    in the desert.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">When you select an object, a building, a Settler or goods
    pile, the appropriate symbol for what you've selected will attach itself to the mouse
    pointer. When this symbol is grayed-out, it is not possible to set your object in the area
    where your mouse is currently located. When the symbol is displayed in color, the object
    can be placed in this area of the map.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">You should raise or lower the terrain on your map before you
    place any objects on it.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Don't forget to put rivers on your map!</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">In order that your map is playable, you must export it using
    &quot;</font><font color="#5A5A5A" size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Export Game Map File...</strong></font><font
    size="2" face="Arial">&quot; in the &quot;</font><font color="#5A5A5A" size="2"
    face="Arial"><strong>File</strong></font><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot; menu.</font></li>
</dir>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">When you export the map, you may be warned of errors. You
can find more information about this in the section, &quot;<a href="../fehler/fehler.htm"><strong>Error
Reports and Warnings</strong></a>&quot;.</font></p>
