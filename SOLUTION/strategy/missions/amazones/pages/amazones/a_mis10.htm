    This mission requires you to protect your Roman allies. In doing so, you must be careful
    not to get into difficulties yourself.</font><font size="2"> </font><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Your ally is not just a millstone around your neck. The Romans supply you
    with iron ore that is not to be found in your territory at all. Although the supply is
    regular, it may not be enough to take care of the requirements for both settlements. There
    is only coal and gold present in the mountain (2) to the east. A little farther to the
    east there is another small mountain (3) where sulfur and gems can be found. With the help
    of your alchemist you can convert the sulfur and gems into iron, thus lessening your
    dependence on your allies!</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You will need the following buildings to guarantee a
    trouble-free development of your colony: 2 smelting works, 2 - 3 weapon smith works, 2 -
    3, and 2 - 3 meadmaker's huts. You will need, in addition, some waterworks so that your
    meadmaker and baker have enough water. Food production is especially important in this
    mission. To ensure optimal production many grain farms and huts for fishermen should be
    built! Fish can be found in adequate quantities in the lake (1) and seas (6 &amp; 7)
    nearby.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Since this is a defensive mission, you should concentrate
    on recruiting a lot of bowmen and some spearmen to be able to ward off the attacks of your
    opponent.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">A major defense problem concerns the positioning of your
    troops. This is true for all missions where an ally needs support. Since the territory of
    your ally is adjacent to yours, it makes sense to bundle your defensive strength, even if
    this cannot be done completely. The ideal positions for this defensive bundling is on your
    common border to the north (4) and to the south (5). Both positions are easily defended.
    You can build up your defense on ONE of these positions and then position all of your
    troops near those of your ally around the castle. If an opponent launches an attack, you
    can quickly come to the aid of your ally's line of defense. You should also use a chain of
    thieves as an early alarm system so that you are not caught off guard.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Your opponents will think twice before attacking as a
    result. You should be careful not to separate your warriors too much but rather to keep
    them together as best as possible so that you have just one powerfull army.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There should be no difficulties holding out for two
    hours. If the enemy attacks, he may well retreat on account of your superior numbers. Let
    him retreat. In this mission, it is up to your opponent to do the attacking...</font></td>
