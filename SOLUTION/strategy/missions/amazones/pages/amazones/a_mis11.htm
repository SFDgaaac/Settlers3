    intelligence isn't exactly their strong point.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>REPORT BY HELIOS</b>: The Roman traitors made things
    very difficult for my friends, and Ch'ih-Yu was angriest of all. Q'nq&uuml;ra savagely teased
    and mocked him - something she is terribly good at. I wondered if perhaps she was doing so
    on purpose to demonstrate that Penthesilea and the Amazons could parry any blow. Although
    she seemed not to have anticipated the forest fire kindled by Ch-ih-Yu's rage, she was
    quite confident that Penthesilea would avenge the attack.</font></td>

    This mission can be played in one of two ways.</font><font size="2"> </font><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You can choose to play tactically (the faster variant) or play
    focusing on mass production.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Taking the tactical option:</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Get the forest fire under control as quickly as possible
    by creating three firebreaks. After you have done this, tear down all the towers and then
    build enough mines on the mountain in your territory. Don't forget to produce enough
    tools.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now it is time to pit your pioneers in the south to work
    so that they can expand your territory to the middle of the map.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You must build up your food production in the optimal
    location and as compactly as possible. The eastern side of the river is your best choice.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You should then build 2 beekeeper's huts quickly because
    it takes a while for them to get going.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The majority of your soldiers (over 70%) should be
    positioned near the border to the Asians in the east.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is important that you build large residences on a
    regular basis.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">By this time you should already have about 80 soldiers
    with a rank of sergeant.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You can now build a large temple because you will be
    needing a couple of priestesses very shortly. If you begin running low on coal or other
    resources, use your thieves to replenish your supplies. Build more storage areas for tools
    (hammers, shovels, picks, axes, saws and also fishing rods) and goods (wood, stone,
    weapons). Have your priests magically transport these to the south where your pioneers
    have been busy.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Between two and four transport ships with pioneers on
    board must now be sent to the south as reinforcements and there you can build up the new
    basis.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You can use the the colony in the north either for
    supplying the south or going on the offensive. In your settlement in the south your main
    priority will be using your pioneers and geologists to explore the worthwhile areas.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Your first building project in the south should be a
    large residence followed by the buildings you need for producing wood and stone.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">As soon as your geologists have discovered mineral
    resources, you can begin building mines. Since there are deposits of sulfur and gems, it
    makes sense to make use of several alchemists.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There are sufficient quantities of fish in the south
    along the coast so that you will be able to feed your miners.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">As soon as you have over 200 warriors (promoted to their
    highest ranks and with a fighting strength of over 90%) and 5 gongs, you can attack the
    Egyptians. First you should cripple the Egyptians' defense facilities and then send your
    gongs to their temples and destroy them.</font></td>
