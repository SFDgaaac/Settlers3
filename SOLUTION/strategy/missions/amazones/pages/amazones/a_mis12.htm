    chance of breaking out of the encircling ring of Amazons, where they could annihilate them
    &gt;from the flanks. But although Q'nq&uuml;ra had ordered the encirclement, it seemed
    Penthesilea knew it to be doomed, for she was already making plans of her own.</font></td>

    There is no easy solution for getting through this mission! </font><p><font color="#800000" size="2" face="Verdana">Two things are extremely important for this
    mission:</font><font size="2" face="Verdana">:</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">- you have to make adjustments for your three separate
    colonies individually (unless or until you are able to connect them).<br>
    - since the outer rim that you occupy is quite large, you should not carry out projects
    widely distanced from one another. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Begin with checking your construction industry in all
    three colonies. In your northern colony you will need woodcutters; in the southern colony
    you have no construction industry at all!</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Immediately tear down all of the towers that are not
    located near the three spokes leading to the hub which is divided among your three
    opponents. Then collect all&nbsp; your troops around these defensive posts.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You should build 3 weapon smith's works and a tool
    smith's works in each of your colonies.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You can supply most of your miners with fish, the rest
    can be supplied with other food. There is no iron to be found in your southern colony but
    an alchemist can be of assistance in this case. Other minerals including gold are
    available.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Build at least 6 beekeeper's huts, 4 - 5 meadmaker's huts
    and the same number of small temples in the northern colony (a part also in the southern
    colony). First, make the map visible and inspect it carefully (especially the south).</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">As soon as you have 300 soldiers in each of your colonies
    (ideally spearmen and swordsmen) promoted to their highest rank and at 100% fighting
    strength, lure the troops of your enemy into your northern colony and let the battle begin
    for your towers.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the meantime you can have your soldiers advance from
    the west and from the south fighting their way toward the middle. All towers that you
    capture during this assault should be torn down immediately.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You should be able to connect your colonies in the south
    and in the west as a result of this maneuver. Now you have to do the same thing so that a
    connection is formed with the northern colony. The rest should be relatively easy.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Shift your weapons production more to the middle. Try to
    make use of gongs where possible. To some extent this will be difficult or even impossible
    because of forests and stones.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Your efforts will soon be crowned with success.</font></td>
