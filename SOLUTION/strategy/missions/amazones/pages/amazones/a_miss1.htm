    on peaceful coexistence. Penthesilea would drive the Egyptians out at all costs, and Horus
    would pay the bill.</font></td>

    Your starting position lies in the far south of the island. From this position you should
    spread out as follows:</font><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You should start off by
    building a medium residence on the grasslands of the peninsula extending eastwards into
    the sea. This can be followed by 3 woodcutter's huts, a sawmill and 2 stonecutter's huts.
    As soon as the first settlers have left the residence, you should adjust the proportion of
    carriers in the menu to 35%. The rest of the new settlers should be converted into
    pioneers. At the same time you can begin with the construction of a second medium
    residence. Have your pioneers concentrate on expanding your territory to include the
    mountain on your northwestern border. Your geologist will discover deposits of iron ore
    and coal there (as shown on the map). Build some mines, an iron smelting works, a weapon
    smith's works and a tool smith's works. The construction sites for these are best located
    in the upper middle area of your territory.</font> </p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">As soon as your second residence is complete, convert a
    majority of the new settlers into pioneers and continue to expand your colony. The entire
    coast in the south is filled with fish so you will have no problems building up your food
    production. Now it is time to build your first large residence.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Continue your building with 2 meadmaker's huts and a
    small temple - a larger temple a little later. On the small peninsula extending westward
    into the sea you can build a forester's hut and 3 beekeeper's huts.There should also be
    enough room there to build 2 farms, a grain mill and bakery. And don't forget to build the
    2 waterworks you will be needing.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You are now ready to begin expanding your territory to
    include the larger heart-shaped mountain to your north. There you will find all the
    minerals you'll need. Build 2 sulfur mines, 2 gem mines and 2 alchemist's dens.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Promote your soldiers now. In this mission (Update 1.51
    or higher) you don't have to rely so much on your bowmen for defense. At the beginning you
    should recruit 50% bowmen and 50 % spearmen, later only spearmen and swordsmen!</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There you go! Start your attack...your opponent should be
    no longer be a problem!</font></td>
