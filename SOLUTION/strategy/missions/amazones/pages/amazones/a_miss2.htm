    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>SITUATION</b>: An advance patrol has left goods for us
    in two locations. With these, we should be able to get a foothold. The Romans on this
    island have been supporting the Egyptians who wanted to occupy our island. We want to make
    them pay dearly for this.</font></p>

    Penthesilia led the Amazon charge. I beseeched Q'nq&uuml;ra to hold the troops in check and
    leave my old friends alone, but she lifted not a finger on their behalf. On a Roman island
    a vanguard had already deposited building materials and tools at two locations, so Jupiter
    would be next to feel their sting.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It was clear Penthesilea aimed to raise a new settlement

    At the beginning of this mission you are sailing on a transport ship in the southwest.
    Here you must make your most important decision. Where should I begin settling? You have 2
    towers at the beginning, that is, you have two territories to choose from, or you can even
    choose neither of the two. Let us help you decide. </font><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">With
    regard to raw materials both starting positions offer nearly identical conditions. The
    starting position (B) in the south, however, is easier to defend, has one more tower and
    is therefore preferable.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Steer your transport ship deep within the large harbor
    (1) on the west coast where your soldiers and pioneers can disembark and proceed on foot
    through the mountain pass until they reach the twin towers (B) - sailing around to the
    east coast takes too long.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Beginning to the northeast of the harbor (A) is also
    possible. You could also try developing in both areas. Although it is more difficult to
    defend two colonies, it is not all impossible.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Promote your warriors to their highest ranks and attack
    your opponent with approximately 200 Amazons. You can risk a frontal attack, using the
    Gong if you want, but this is not absolutely necessary. If you find the resistance
    stronger than you anticipated, you could land from the sea behind your enemy and attack
    him on two fronts.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Defense</b>: The usual combination of several large
    towers, fully garrisoned, with nearby infantry is a good idea.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Problem</b>: </font><font color="#800000" size="2" face="Verdana">I can't find any tools!!!</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The tools are available in both settlement areas but they
    are scattered around, some are outside the borders. Use your pioneers for locating and
    making the tools available to your carriers.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Problem</b>:</font><font color="#800000" size="2" face="Verdana"> One of my settlements always gets overrun!</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You don't need towers in both areas. you can do without
    towers in one area and expand your territory there using pioneers.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Problem</b>: </font><font color="#800000" size="2" face="Verdana">Where are the fish hiding?</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The best fishing spots are the lakes (2) and the harbors
    (3). It is worthwhile building several fisherman's huts here.</font></td>
