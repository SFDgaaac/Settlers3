    the holy mountain in the middle of the enclosed area.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>DEFEAT CONDITION</b>: Your settlement has been
    completely destroyed.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>SITUATION</b>: After blowing the Romans and Egyptians
    off the field, it is now time for the Asians to get a taste of what it means to be merely
    men. A well-protected mountain is dedicated to their blow-hard god, Ch'ih-Yu. We'll have
    to change that even though the going will be rough without any trees growing on the
    mountain.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>REPORT BY HELIOS</b>: Ch'ih-Yu had always been a
    bit...slow.... One of the nicer gods to be sure, but you could almost see a thought
    struggling to make it from one side of his thick head to the other. So: Jupiter and Horus
    had lost their hides to the Amazons? What business was that of his?</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">But of course he should have seen the danger before
    Q'nq&uuml;ra ordered Penthesilea to conquer one of his lairs. A holy mountain it was,
    surrounded by snow and close to impregnable.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">To her credit Penthesilea managed to erect a small
    outpost in the vicinity, but development of the settlement faltered due to lack of a
    forest nearby. Suddenly the Amazons were sitting ducks for the Asian army and Ch'ih-Yu's
    fiery breath, who would sooner or later break through to exact their revenge.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yet Q'nq&uuml;ra's smile betrayed something more...</font></td>

    Your main colony is located at the tip of the &quot;arrow&quot; in the northeast. You also
    have a small colony within the mountain ring in the southeast.</font><font size="2"> </font><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There is no need for alarm when you cannot find any hammers in
    your main colony - there are none at the beginning. You have 3 iron smelting works there,
    though. To avoid early surprise attacks, tear down all of your towers in the north. Now
    you have an hour before your opponent makes his way through the snow. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You should first focus on building up your construction
    industry by building at least 6 woodcutter's huts, 2 forester's huts, 2 sawmills, and an
    additional stonecutter's hut.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The eastern end of the &quot;arrowhead&quot; is well
    suited for 4 - 5 beekeeper's huts. You will also need 3 meadmaker's huts, a waterworks, 2
    small temples and 1 large temple.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the south you can get your mining industry going with
    2 goldmines, 2 coalmines and 2 gold smelting works. You can then convert the carriers to
    pioneers to expand your colony there a little.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the meantime you should have 2 storage areas filled
    with wood and stone. Place your priest in the middle of the storage area, use the spell to
    transport goods and then work in the southern colony can begin.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now is the time for you to get started with your food
    production in the north (fish and bread). This can be transported to your colony in the
    south by using your priests again.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Build 2 iron ore mines and 2 coalmines and then you can
    get started on recruiting 5 soldiers. Keep in mind that the gold must be stored so that
    your soldiers can reach 77% fighting strength.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now you only need to place your warriors in the circle of
    stones! There should be no problem getting this done within an hour.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">An extra tip: You can also use the spell &quot;Heavenly
    Presents&quot;. This will save you some extra time getting the goods you need.</font></td>
