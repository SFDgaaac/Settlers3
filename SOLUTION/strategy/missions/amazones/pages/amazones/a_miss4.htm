    formed an alliance, preparing to settle things once and for all with a swift and mighty
    blow. But Penthesilea was not just a pawn of Q'nq&uuml;ra's: she was also the daughter of
    Priam, king of Troy. Her defenses were strong, and though there was still much to be done,
    the men were welcome to attack. Even as one.</font></td>

    Your goal in this mission is to destroy as many enemy soldiers as possible and ensure your
    own survival. </font><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The two key positions in this
    mission are the passages (1 &amp; 2). They are well protected from direct attacks because
    of the streams isolating them from the passages. Your opponents first have to go through
    the narrow passage and double back to attack the towers. This allows your bowmen a good
    opportunity to thin their ranks. You can further exploit this advantage by building
    additonal towers in these positions. Position your soldiers (especially your bowmen)
    behind the streams so that your opponent suffers maximum losses before reaching your
    warriors.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">At the beginning you will be confronting an army far
    superior in numbers. Each of your soldiers is important and should not be used as cannon
    fodder. Make generous use of your healers in this mission.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is particularly important that you constantly recruit
    new soldiers because you will be attacked and will lose soldiers steadily.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">A major problem in this mission is the distance to the
    mountain in the east that you must quickly bring under your control. You will need the
    minerals there to ensure that you can continue recruiting new soldiers. If you don't
    manage, your three opponents will overrun you easily.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Connect your two colonies as quickly as possible by using
    your pioneers. Make sure that you construct buildings that supply others, close together,
    to keep transport distances short. Build your smelting works and your food production
    buildings near the mountain so that the mines can be supplied quickly and efficiently.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Problem</b>: </font><font color="#800000" size="2" face="Verdana">Where can I find fish here?</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There are some excellent fishing spots along the coast
    (3,4 &amp; 6) and at the lake (5).</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Problem</b>: </font><font color="#800000" size="2" face="Verdana">My opponents keep running deep within my territory and try to capture my
    towers!</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Tear down all of the towers within your colony except for
    those at the two crucial passages. Build additional towers there concentrating your
    strength in these two locations.&nbsp; Only a small tower which is surrounded by water
    south of the western passage (1) may be left standing because it is easy to defend. Be
    careful here because your opponent will often try to capture this tower!</font></td>
