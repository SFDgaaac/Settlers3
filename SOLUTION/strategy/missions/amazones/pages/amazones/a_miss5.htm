    first with your Holy Gongs.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Then vanquish your enemy.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>DEFEAT CONDITION</b>: Your colony has been completely
    destroyed.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>SITUATION</b>: After beating back the cowardly attack
    of the men, we went on the offensive. As it first appeared, perhaps a bit hastily. The
    Asians were strong, for men, that is. The forest was their weakness though, and there we
    focused our energy.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>REPORT BY HELIOS</b>: I began to feel sorry for my old
    friends, but what was I to do? If Q'nq&uuml;ra didn't always fight fairly, she was still my
    daughter. And even as I was torn by allegiances I could see the next catastrophe coming.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">My friends had seized an early advantage over the Amazons
    through Ch'ih-Yu - who had obviously been disregarded as a threat by Q'nq&uuml;ra. He had
    succeeded in establishing a large settlement that was soon to become a certain danger to
    the Amazons. Penthesilea would have to use all her skills as a commander to stop the Asian
    settlement from growing even larger.</font></td>

    Your starting position is on the land mass in the northeast.</font><font size="2"> </font><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There are two alternatives for beginning this mission:</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The first alternative begins with your priest casting the
    spell &quot;Disperse fog&quot;.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Next, you send your gongs toward the wood production in
    the west of your opponent's territory (see map in game and the map above). Bring your
    warriors back to your colony for defensive purposes. As soon as the gongs get to their
    destination, you can send one to the western coast to begin its work, the second to the
    south and the third begins working on the nearby buildings. The 24 enemy soldiers will get
    there far too late to stop you.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the meantime, 2 towers should be built in the north so
    that you gain access to stone reserves. It is also important that you have your wood
    production up and running quickly (at least 6 woodcutter's huts, 2 forester's huts and 2
    sawmills). Another 2 stonecutter's huts must be built as well.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The second alternative is the simplest one. You simply
    consolidate all your soldiers and instruments of war and take your chances in battle. In
    this case your opponent will usually attack earlier.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The mountain south of your colony can supply you with all
    the mineral resources you need. If you are able to expand your territory to include the
    other two mountains with the help of your pioneers, things will go even faster.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There are also gems and sulfur present in the mountains
    which means you can build alchemist's dens for producing iron and gold!</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now you can begin with some serious weapon production. In
    the initial phase you should produce more bows; in the later phases you should produce
    more spears and swords.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is also advisable to build one or two more gongs. You
    can then destroy the first row of towers without losing troops under fire immediately.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You can either wait until you have a large army of
    warriors or you can also try smaller attacks earlier. It is easier for you when you attack
    using both land connections to the land mass in the south.</font></td>
