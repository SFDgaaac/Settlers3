    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>DEFEAT CONDITION</b>: Your colony has been completely
    destroyed.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>SITUATION</b>: There is hardly any iron or coal but we
    can cope with that just as we coped with the cowardly Romans and Egyptians. Nothing will
    stop us from freeing this island from male dominion.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>REPORT BY HELIOS</b>: Penthesilea had been slowed but
    not stopped. Yet while she clashed with the Asians, the Romans and Egyptians settled on
    another island, taking advantage of the calm to put a stranglehold on any available
    resources.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I knew Q'nq&uuml;ra would not give in quietly. Until the men
    were broken and banished her victory would not be complete. But for the first time, when
    the Amazons set to work, I really wondered how they were going to meet the challenge from
    my old friends.</font></td>

    In this mission it is not so important how fast you mount the first attacks but rather how
    quickly you can recruit soldiers for your defense.</font><font size="2"> </font><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Begin by building 3 woodcutter's huts, 2 forester's huts, a
    sawmill and a stonecutter's hut. Then you should build a medium residence and afterwards
    build the same group of buildings again.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Try to expand your territory with pioneers to include as
    much of the land mass in the center of the map as possible because important minerals are
    present in each of the mountains. Ideally, you should convert the 30 settlers from the
    first medium residence you build into pioneers.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now build another residence, this time a large one, and
    then have your geologists explore all of the mountains nearby.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Since there is little iron ore and relatively little coal
    available, you should continue, building a sulfur mine, gem mine, an alchemist's den, one
    or more storage areas (for the gold), coal mine, iron smelting works and a barracks.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You can supply your miners' food needs with honey for the
    sulfur miners and&nbsp; fish (available in abundance) for the others.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">With 4 beekeeper's huts and 2 meadmaker's huts your
    soldiers' promotions should proceed quickly.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now it is only a matter of holding out until the fighting
    strength of your soldiers reaches 100%.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You will be attacked from time to time, but you can
    withstand the attacks of your opponent without any serious difficulties.</font></td>
