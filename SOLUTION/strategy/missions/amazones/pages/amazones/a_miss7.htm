    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Destroy the large temple which lies on a peninsula and is

    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>DEFEAT CONDITION</b>: Your colony has been completely
    destroyed.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>SITUATION</b>: The men seem to be getting nervous and
    are resorting to unfair tactics. We don't need trees to get the building materials we
    need. The Asian storehouses are full of what we need. As soon as we get Q'nq&uuml;ra's help in
    getting trees, we'll have a little surprise for Ch'ih-Yu and his ridiculous temple.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>REPORT BY HELIOS</b>: Ch'ih-Yu let his fiery breath do
    the talking, and his oration was persuasive. In the midst of their expansion the Amazons
    lost a ship of saplings and foresters to his angry flames.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Suddenly the lack of forest on the coming battlefield
    became critical, but Penthesilea did not shy away. Not enough trees and manna for a Tree
    Curse where they were going? Well the necessary planks would simply have to be obtained
    elsewhere...though the Asians would of course be reluctant to part with them.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Ch'ih-Yu had openly defied Q'nq&uuml;ra and her army, and he
    would have to pay for that. But until that moment, the Amazons would have to be careful,
    because the Asians clearly had the upper hand.</font></td>

    The first thing you want to do is bring all your soldiers and pioneers in the southwest
    (1) to your colony in the southeast as quickly as possible because building up your
    infrastructure and defense will be significantly easier. </font><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Your efforts at building up an infrastructure will be hampered because it
    will not be possible for you to build a forester's hut and you won't be able to renew your
    supply of trees. Because of this you should get an early start on building up your manna
    production. Your priestesses can then cast the &quot;Forest Favor&quot; spell to
    compensate for your lack of a forester. This also helps you in achieving the objective of
    this mission: the production of 500 units of manna.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Your second task is the destruction of the big temple of
    the Asian tribe on the landmass&nbsp; to the north of your colony. It is well guarded,
    well protected by mountains and difficult to reach by land. You have better chances using
    transport ships which could land nearby (5 or 6). There you can unload and collect your
    soldiers with less stress.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Going by foot is much more difficult. Your opponent has
    many towers (7) which make getting across the two narrow land passages quite complicated.
    &nbsp; Your second Asian opponent (4) is located very near you to the west can be avoided
    but it more advantageous, in contrast to the other Asian tribe, to destroy this weaker
    opponent so that you have access to the mineral resources there and have your westen front
    freed up.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Problem</b>: </font><font color="#800000" size="2" face="Verdana">I have too little iron ore and gold!</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Build some alchemist's huts near the small mountain (8).
    Sulfur and gems can be found there which can be converted into gold and iron ore.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Problem</b>: </font><font color="#800000" size="2" face="Verdana">Fish...?</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">...can be found in sufficient quantities in the northwest
    of your colony (9) and in the lake (10) which your Asian opponent to the west controls.</font></td>
