    build up a colony. This colony must have 5 large residences.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>DEFEAT CONDITION</b>: Your old colony is completely
    destroyed before you have completed your new one.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>SITUATION</b>: Sometimes it's wise to beat a retreat -
    to come back stronger later. We can't hold out long here but we must hold out until our
    new colony is ready. These Roman weaklings shouldn't be that big a problem.</font></p>

    resolve. There were times when I wouldn't have bet on either side, and this was one of
    those times.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Surrounded by Romans, it was only a question of time
    before her settlement could no longer be held, but Penthesilea did not shrink from battle.
    Q'nq&uuml;ra came to her aide by locating an island surrounded by impregnable reefs, which
    could not be taken by sea. But as to how to conquer it - she left that challenge to
    Penthesilea.</font></td>

    This is a purely defensive mission. You should therefore build your infrastructure
    accordingly and not be distracted by your opponent.</font><font size="2"> </font><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Concentrate your defense on one or two towers and group all your
    warriors together to the east of the mountain in your territory (1). This will cause your
    opponent to think twice before attacking, which doesn't mean that he won't attack at all.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You should build up your colony quickly. The following
    buildings are especially important: buildings for your manna production so that you can
    magically transport goods to your new settlement on the island in the northeast and a tool
    smith's works so that you can produce enough tools for the new settlement.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Otherwise you shouldn't construct any buildings you don't
    really need. Your prime objective is building up the infrastructure you need on the island
    (4) in the northeast so that you can build 5 large residences there.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The first tools to be sent over to the new colony are
    shovels and hammers so that you can construct more buildings. Your first building should
    be a residence so that you get more settlers. You should then magically transport picks
    and axes to the new colony and build woodcutter's and stonecutter's huts. The land can
    then be cleared for the construction of the large residences you need. The wood and stone
    that is produced can be stored and then used for the construction of the residences.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">While the infrastructure is being built up on the island,
    you should also reinforce your defenses in your starting colony. It would be a shame if
    you were overrun just before the large residences on the island were finished. Build up
    food production and produce as many spears and bows for your warriors as you can in this
    phase, because they are particularly effective for defensive tasks.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#800000" size="2" face="Verdana"><b>A possibility for avoiding attack</b></font><font size="2" face="Verdana">:</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">After you are able to begin building on the new island,
    construct a small tower. When the tower is occupied with a soldier, you can tear down all
    the towers in your original colony and you will no longer be attacked.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fish are particularly plentiful along the coasts to the
    east and west of your starting tower (2 &amp; 3).</font></td>
