    foothold was a tenuous one, Penthesilea was as determined as she was resourceful. If the
    ground she was on was barren of stones, then she'd simply launch a few raids and quarry
    them in that fashion...</font></td>

    Your first problem in this mission will be the shortage of building stone. The key to
    solving this problem is your thieves. There is a Roman settlement in the south with
    several storage areas (2 &amp; 3) filled with stone. Start off by building a medium
    residence so that you can convert new settlers into thieves and have them swipe as much as
    possible from the Romans. The Romans will be occupied with garrisoning all of their towers
    at the beginning and won't be able to detect your thieves with patrolling soldiers. Take
    advantage of this situation as long as you can because it will not last forever!</font><font size="2"> </font><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">While your thieves are busy, you should
    have your pioneers expand your territory westward to include the mountain (1) there, which
    has all of the minerals you need in sufficient quantities. It is still a good idea to
    secure the passage to the mountain in the south (4) because it contains large deposits of
    gems and sulfur which you can put to good use later. Your alchemist can convert these
    minerals into gold and iron which will, in turn, decrease your needs for coal.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Since neither of your opponents will attack so quickly,
    you have the opportunity to promote your warriors beforehand. Set up your manna production
    quickly, making sure that you always have enough warriors for the protection of your
    colony! Store the weapons you produce at first, but be careful that your opponent doesn't
    exploit this.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">As soon as you have recruited 250 - 300 highly ranked
    soldiers, you should launch an attack on the Romans. Attack across both land passages so
    that your opponent is forced to defend himself on two fronts and must split his forces. Be
    alert during your attack that the Egyptians do not try to take advantage of this situation
    by attacking you suddenly. Tear down the towers of the Romans as soon as you have captured
    them so that the Egyptians are not tempted to attack!</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">As soon as you have completely conquered the Romans,
    begin building up another weapons production center on the mountain in the previously
    Roman-held settlement in the west. Now it is up to you to concentrate all your strength to
    be able to stymie the Egyptians.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Smelt and store as much gold as possible to increase the
    fighting strength of your warriors - an attack on the Egyptians with less than 100%
    fighting strength is almost certainly doomed to failure! Since the Egyptians have had
    ample time to expand and to recruit soldiers, they are very strong. You should have
    several well functioning weapons centers running full blast to make up for their lead. It
    will often be possible for your opponent to amass an army of some 700 - 800 soldiers and
    only seldom does he suffer from an earlier setback. As a result, you will need a huge army
    and should attack on several fronts. Not everyone will be able to master this mission on
    the first go, so remember to save your game before attacking the Egyptians so that you can
    reload if you are not successful on your first attempt!</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Good Luck!</font></p>
    <p><font color="#800000" size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Bonus</b></font><font size="2" face="Verdana">:</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">If you look carefully, you will notice that there are
    some weapons and gold bars near the ships (5) that are there for the taking. Use your
    pioneers or thieves to take advantage of this!</font></td>
