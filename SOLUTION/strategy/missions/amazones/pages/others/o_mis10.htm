    offensive, but the response of dear Q'nq&uuml;ra seemed far too restrained. My friends brushed
    my concerns aside with another round, reminding me that she was only a woman, and the more
    they drank the less of a threat she became. Sure, there was a march ahead, and a land
    bridge to conquer, but couldn't everyone see that the destruction of the Amazons was near?</font></td>

    As you can see from the map above, the passage is now closed.</font><font size="2"> </font><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Since you are starting off with a solid infrastructure, you will
    only have to work on gearing up your economy.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There is very little raw materials in the main part of
    your colony (except fish). For this reason it would be wise to set up a trade route early
    on to the land mass in the northwest.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You should also get an early start on building a tool
    smith's works and send the goods produced to the new colony there where you can set up
    mining facilities. Of course, it is also a good idea to build a couple fisherman's huts
    there.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You should secure the passage to your opponent early,
    ideally using large towers.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">As soon as your defenses are stong enough, you should
    destroy the castles of the Amazons with your cannons. Don't forget to reload.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In this way you can lure your opponent into bringing his
    troops into the trap (your well protected fortress) and you won't have to battle against a
    huge army later.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">All of your soldiers should have the highest rank and
    should also have a fighting strength of at least 70%. This will make it easier to defeat
    the Amazons.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is possible for you to land at the narrow place (in
    the north of the Amazon territory) with transport ships and then capture the large and
    small towers there, choking off your opponent's supplies of coal and iron ore.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You can then launch a second attack in the south and
    cripple the production of iron bars there. There should then be no further problems taking
    control of the rest of the enemy territory. Make use of your cannons to shorten the
    process of capturing the remaining towers.</font></td>
