    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>SITUATION</b>: DThe Amazons are as good as defeated.
    The Egyptians should be able to deal with them. After all, it was Horus with his
    sand-table exercises who had gotten us into this nice mess. We will go and see if the
    Amazons and Egyptians can provide us with some kind of compensation. We are desperate for
    some coal. Fortunately, our enemies have more than enough of that stuff ...</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>REPORT BY HELIOS</b>: When Horus finally put his
    planning to good use, Jupiter was already thinking of the days after the war, reminding
    himself that when two gods quarrel the third rejoices. He noted that while the Egyptians
    and Amazons were engaged at the front, a responsible god would not miss the opportunity to
    look over their lands and make off with anything that was not nailed down.</font></td>

    Since you hardly have any coal, you should look into the possibilities of
    &quot;borrowing&quot; some from the Romans and Egyptians. </font><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is important to get production of your building materials going as soon
    as possible (wood and stone). Then you should look into increasing your settler population
    (a large residence would be a good choice). Expand your colony quickly. Especially on the
    eastern side of the mountain you will find some coal.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Keep your thieves busy. They can help you out a lot with
    getting the coal you will need. But, when they find other interesting resources, tools or
    weapons, let them bring you back what you can use.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">With a little careful planning you will be able to build
    up to 6 iron ore mines. This number of mines should be able to supply 3 - 4 iron smelting
    works and 4 - 5 weapon smith's works. This will enable you to produce the weapons you need
    quickly.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the meantime it is also important that you increase
    your production of manna by building more wine farms and a small temple.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Remember to build enough residences as you go along.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">As far as possible you should also try to build as many
    additional coal mines as you can so that you are not overly dependent on the activities of
    your thieves.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fish and some bread should be enough to satisfy the food
    needs of your miners. As soon as you have about 200 soldiers (Rank of captain and 80%
    fighting strength), you can risk your first attack on the Egyptians.&nbsp; Choose your
    approach on the basis of reconnaissance you have already carried out so that you can keep
    your losses minimal while you are underway.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You should now be able to destroy the Amazon temple
    without experiencing any undue difficulties.</font></td>
