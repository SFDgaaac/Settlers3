    have been completely destroyed.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>SITUATION</b>: The Romans think they have gotten off

    alone, they have another think coming. The Romans will soon be enjoying a thawing
    experience.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>REPORT BY HELIOS</b>: Horus was understandably furious
    at Jupiter. He declared that he was finished, having done more than his share, and told
    the others to be so kind as to bring the whole ordeal to an end.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Ch'ih-Yu, for whom the celebration of victory - with its
    roast ox - was quite an incentive, set to work immediately. Jupiter, however, sullen at
    never having wreaked havoc with a glorious deluge, declared that he too had done enough,
    and in any case certainly more than Horus. Sending an enormous blizzard forth, he cut off
    his Roman subjects from the outside world, then feigned powerlessness when Ch'ih-Yu called
    for help.</font></p>

    Jupiter told him he'd have to wait for a thaw, he managed to do just that.</font></td>

    In this mission you will need a lot of settlers quickly because the area that you have to
    cover to find and mine resources or gain access to swampland is quite large. You will need
    a lot of thieves, geologists and pioneers especially! The pioneers should. The first
    priority for your pioneers is expanding your territory to include the 6 small mountains
    surrounding your settlement, the large swamplands (2) to the east, the lake (1) and then
    finally the mountains (4 &amp; 5) further north. You should do this in this sequence. The
    last two mountains can be taken somewhat later. </font><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It
    is relatively easy to recognize that the important places on this map are all not near
    your colony, but in some cases quite far away. Pioneers are key figures on this map!</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You have to expand your territory to include the small
    mountains surrounding your colony so that you are able to produce the tools you will need
    for getting these wide expanses of territory under control quickly. The tools you have at
    the beginning won't be enough.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Building a couple of forester's huts at the beginning
    would be a wise idea. You will notice that there are relatively few trees nearby and
    without the foresters you will run out of wood quickly.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The main danger in this mission is the speed at which
    your opponent develops. If you leave your opponent in peace too long, he will become too
    strong and later it will be nearly impossible to defeat him. Some possibilities for
    weakening your opponent are: </font><ul>
      <li><font size="2" face="Verdana">Cleaning out some of the towers that secure the
        northwestern approach (3) to the Amazons with your cannons is a good idea. If the main
        attack takes place here later, you could easily lose half your army otherwise because your
        opponent will defend this location very heavily later. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Verdana">Using your transport ships is also helpful. You can try an
        early attack using your transport ships. Especially the Amazon tribe (Am2) in the south is
        a good target for an attack because it is not as strong as the Amazon tribe in the north
        and it is easier to reach. You could land on the southwest coast of the Amazon colony (6).
        You probably won't be able to destroy your opponent with this attack but it is enough to
        deprive them of some important buildings, especially farms, residences, smelting works,
        smith's works and mines.This attack is only an example of many possibilities that can be
        carried out using your transport ships. Before beginning any attacks like this, use your
        thieves for scouting purposes.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There are many possibilities for attacking your opponent,
    but this will all depend on your general approach in this mission. An land-based attack is
    only possible over the narrow crossings in the north (3). Before you decide on this
    variation, you should destroy the towers securing the passage with your cannons or you
    will be taking too many losses. Once you have broken through, you will be faced with a
    large number of Amazon warriors that will come from all over the Amazon colony as
    reinforcements. Here you have to be prepared for a long and hard battle that could be very
    difficult to win if you have not taken measures earlier to weaken your opponent.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">To make matters even worse, often a second Amazon tribe
    will enter into the fray and you will quickly become a decided underdog. You do have
    allies, though. The Romans are trapped inside a mountain ring surrounded by snow. The
    Romans cannot help themselves but your priests have a spell (Melting Snow) to melt the
    snow. This is no easy task, however, because this mountain ring is completely within
    Amazon territory and also surrounded by towers. It will be very difficult getting your
    priest near enough to work his spell. The northeastern arc (7) of this mountain ring is
    relatively weakly protected and offers the best chances of suceeding. To avoid sending any
    of your priests on a kamikaze mission, you should scout the area carefully with your
    thieves to determine exactly how strong the defense is there. Ideally you could have a
    couple spearsmen flanking your priests and drawing the fire of the enemy bowmen so that
    your priests can get on with melting a way through to the Romans.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">As soon as your allies have been freed, your enemies will
    begin to attack the Romans which, in turn, gives you a little more breathing space. Now is
    the time to attack. Try to coordinate your efforts with those of the Romans. You can
    provoke your enemy into battles and lure them to your allies - take advantage of every
    opportunity of fighting together with the Romans.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Another possibility is a massive sea-based invasion with
    several transport ships landing in a weakly defended spot, the northeastern arc (7) for
    example. &gt;From there you can free the Romans and then together battle against the
    oncoming Amazons.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Once you have gained the upper hand, the destruction of
    your two opponents becomes only a question of time. Don't underestimate the isolated
    castles of your enemy. Haphazard attacks will only result in unacceptably high casualties
    among your soldiers.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Problem</b>: </font><font color="#800000" size="2" face="Verdana">There are not enough fish in the big lake!</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Your priests can again be helpful here. The spell
    &quot;Flood of Fish&quot; cast near the lake should give you all the fish you need.</font></td>
