    150 bars of gold.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>DEFEAT CONDITION</b>: You have been completely
    demolished.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>SITUATION:</b> What is going on here? Women, who go to
    war instead of taking care of children. It was understandable that our warriors only
    defended themselves half-heartedly at the beginning. And Jupiter will certainly help us
    convert those female barbarians to our side.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>REPORT BY HELIOS</b>: Jupiter was enraged. Not only
    were the Amazons poised to overwhelm one of his settlements at Q'nq&uuml;ra's request, but it
    was beginning to look as if his subjects were incapable of defending themselves. When he
    finally managed to slip away for a goblet of wine at the Gorgons, he said they'd even
    become desperate enough to bother him with converting soldiers.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Clearly he was not enjoying himself. To tussle a bit with
    Horus or Ch'ih-Yu was all in good fun - but these were women, and they were winning! But
    though he struggled with too few soldiers and not enough iron, there was still gold to be
    had...and Jupiter always enjoyed his riches ...</font></td>

    </b></font><font size="2" face="Verdana">Right at the beginning you should convert the
    Amazon warriors to have more military muscle for your defense and to get to the iron ore
    deposits in the mountains (2). Then get started as soon as possible with recruiting
    soldiers. Keep in mind that you only have to defend yourself in this mission. This means
    recruiting primarily spearmen and bowmen and building some big towers to prepare an
    optimal defense. </font><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">As soon as your settlement is
    well secured, you can concentrate on producing gold. For defending against heavy enemy
    attacks you can use magic - &quot;Convert Barbarians&quot; is especially effective.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Your opponent will generally approach across a ford in
    the river (3). Don't build any towers too near the enemy because this provokes them to
    attack earlier and more aggressively.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Problem</b>: </font><font color="#800000" size="2" face="Verdana">I don't have enough soldiers (and no iron ore to produce weapons so that I
    can recruit more soldiers)!</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The mountain to the west only has deposits of coal and
    gold - no iron ore will be found there. Fom the very beginning though, you have enough
    manna to allow your priests to cast the &quot;Convert Barbarians&quot; spell. Have your
    priests cast this spell at position (2). There are a couple Amazon warriors there guarding
    the iron ore deposits. This is your only nearby possibility of getting access to the iron
    ore you need.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Take your priests and try to convert, if possible, all of
    the Amazons positioned around the tower in one go so that you can take over the tower and
    thus have control of this valuable mountain with its iron ore resources.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Get an early start on mining and smelting gold because
    this mission requires that you produce 150 bars of gold. The faster you do this, the
    faster you can bring this mission to a successful conclusion. Don't forget to keep your
    settlement adequately defended. All of the gold you have smelted is worthless if your
    colony is overrun by the Amazons.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Problem</b>: </font><font color="#800000" size="2" face="Verdana">I can't find enough building stone!</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There is a strip of desert (1) in the northwest where
    building stone can be found in sufficient quantities. Use your pioneers to take control of
    this area as quickly as possible!</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Problem</b>: </font><font color="#800000" size="2" face="Verdana">I can't find enough fish!</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There is a lake to the east of your settlement with
    adequate supplies of fish.</font></td>
