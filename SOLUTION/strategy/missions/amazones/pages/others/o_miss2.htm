    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>SITUATION</b>: We had already heard about the Roman
    wimps and their problems with a horde of feral women, but we would have never even dreamed
    that even we, the sons of the mighty Ch'ih-Yu could become the target of their attacks.
    But, no sooner said than done, they had invaded a swampland. We, of course, couldn't
    tolerate that. Rice production in the hands of women ... a gruesome thought.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>REPORT BY HELIOS</b>: Jupiter had hardly recovered
    when we noticed that Ch'ih-Yu was now missing from our table. Almost immediately he sent
    word that the Amazons were trying to capture a swamp from his troops, but he was sure it
    wouldn't take long to defeat them. He asked us to put in an order for him for half an
    oxen, but Jupiter told us to hold off. &quot;They are tougher than is fit for women&quot;,
    he declared; and his words were a portent. For days we heard naught of our friend.</font></td>

    Your first priority is adequately securing your settlement by building 3 - 4 large towers
    on the eastern borders of your territory. Your second priority is recruiting enough
    soldiers because an attack later will require a lot of soldiers. In addition to the coal
    deposits you find to the south of your colony, there is also a mountain in the east where
    additional deposits of coal can be found in case your first supplies run out. </font><p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Problem</b>: </font><font color="#800000" size="2" face="Verdana">How can I build up a good defense?</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You won't need to build a long defensive chain of towers.
    3 - 4 towers should be enough to counter enemy attacks. You should have enough soldiers to
    act as reinforcements though to keep your opponent occupied.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In order to carry out an attack later, you should
    concentrate on recruiting swordsmen and bowmen - the bowmen can deal with the enemy
    soldiers while your swordsmen deal with enemy towers.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Problem</b>: </font><font color="#800000" size="2" face="Verdana">There is no iron ore on the mountain in the south!</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There is only coal on the mountain (2) in the south -
    iron ore and gold are only present in the north (1). You should, therefore, build your
    iron smelting works equally distant from both mountains to keep transport distances at a
    minimum.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Problem</b>: </font><font color="#800000" size="2" face="Verdana">I can't acquire manna without a swamp!</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is true, but there is a small swamp to the north of
    your starting position. You might be able to take control of the large swamp (4) but you
    shouldn't rely on too much divine support in this mission...</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Problem</b>: </font><font color="#800000" size="2" face="Verdana">I always lose far too many soldiers during attacks!</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The difficult terrain is to blame. The soldiers should be
    divided into groups (swordsmen, bowmen,...) with the bulk of the attacking troups
    consisting of swordsmen and bowmen since spearmen are relatively slow and as such are easy
    marks for the enemy troops. Your bowmen should be available in any case because they are
    very useful in large groups against attacking opponents. Swordsmen should be set loose on
    enemy towers to conquer them quickly.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Always concentrate your attacks on only 2 or 3 towers
    before moving on. Your soldiers should be guided through the swamps in an adroit manner so
    that they don't attract too much enemy fire.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">As an alternative to attacking with a mass of soldiers,
    you could also make use of cannons. These can bring enemy towers under fire from a safe
    distance and render them harmless. The sulfur that you'll need for firing the cannons can
    be found on a mountain (5) in the south of the settlement.</font></td>
