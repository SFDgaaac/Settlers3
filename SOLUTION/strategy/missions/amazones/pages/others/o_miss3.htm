    CONDITION</b>: Establish your colony in the southwest and survive for 2 hours.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>DEFEAT CONDITION</b>: You have been completely
    decimated.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>SITUATION</b>: Horus is anticipating an attack from
    the women soon and wants to begin a new colony as a tactical diversion until the true
    colony has gained sufficient strength.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>REPORT BY HELIOS</b>: When Ch'ih-Yu finally returned
    it took time - and a great deal of food - to restore his spirits. Horus wisely learned
    from the laxity of the others and confided - as one sun god to another - that he was using
    an evasive maneuver to distract the Amazons' attention.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It was a fortunate move, for in no time it was he who was
    missing from the rounds at our table. Holding his position until reinforcements could
    reach his remote settlement would not be easy, but then again Horus had always regarded
    himself a master strategist. Maybe that's what you tell yourself when the subjects you
    rule live in an oversized sandbox.</font></td>

    In this mission the first 15 minutes are especially important because the settlement has
    to be moved to a more secure area. </font><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">First you have
    to convert your carriers to pioneers so that they can move outside your current borders.
    Then the pioneers and soldiers can be sent to the more secure area in one of two ways. </font><ul>
      <li><font size="2" face="Verdana">You can simply race through enemy territory as briskly as
        possible and risk the loss of some settlers. There are two passages, (2) and (3), which
        lead to the desired location. Both passages involve crossing enemy territory though... </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Verdana">Your second alternative involves building a transport ship
        which can be commissioned at the shipyards (1). When the transport ship is finished, the
        pioneers and soldiers can be brought on board and then sent to the secure area, first
        sailing southward and then westward.&nbsp; This is a considerably safer choice but is also
        more time-consuming.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">After reaching this area you should concentrate on
    getting your defense up to par as quickly as possible. Some large towers should be built
    near the isthmus in the east. Afterwards, you should devote your efforts to recruiting
    enough soldiers that you can withstand enemy attacks that will follow.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thieves prove to be very useful for not only enriching
    your own supply of goods and materials but also for disrupting your opponents' production
    of tools and weapons.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Problem</b>: </font><font color="#800000" size="2" face="Verdana">I can't manage to get my settlers to the new area safely.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Try the different alternatives described above. You won't
    always manage to break through on the first try. You might also try a diversionary tactic.
    Attack your opponent with one soldier somewhere in his settlement and then quickly move
    through his territory with the rest of your settlers. It is also a good idea to save your
    game at opportune stages.</font></td>
