    a thriving settlement and produce 600 manna points.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>DEFEAT CONDITION</b>: You have been completely
    obliterated.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>SITUATION</b>: Very kind indeed of the Egyptians to
    back us up, even though we do not need that. Like as not it is going to be us who will
    have to support those dune hoppers. At least, we can see to our settlement till then. And
    provide Ch'ih-Yu with plenty of rice wine.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>REPORT BY HELIOS</b>: Having had their taste of battle
    with the Amazons, my old friends conspired and planned. Ch'ih-Yu was assigned the first
    mission, for no better reason than that he was incapable of saying 'no' to the others.
    Charged with raising a settlement in a key area, Horus would protect the Asian troops by
    intercepting the Amazons' attacks. Though Horus surprised us all when he volunteered for
    the mission, I suspect he meant only to prompt another tributary pyramid from his
    subjects.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the meantime, Jupiter was to devote himself to a plot
    for revenge against Q'nq&uuml;ra, and devote himself he did. While the others fought he missed
    not a drop at our table.</font></td>

    Battles are of secondary importance in this mission. </font><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">As in nearly all missions, it is important to build up a good
    infrastructure.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">To get going you should build a medium residence, 3
    woodcutter's huts, 1 forester's hut and a sawmill. Afterwards, you can build a
    stonecutter's hut.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Change your first new settlers into pioneers, sending
    part of them to expand your territory in the direction of the mountain and another part
    toward the east in the direction of the swamp.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now you should pump up your wood production so that you
    have altogether 6 woodcutter's huts, two forester's huts and a sawmill. You should also
    build another 2 medium residences.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">As soon as the residences have been built, convert some
    of the carriers to pioneers and send them to the east to support the other pioneers there.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now you should build a couple fisherman's huts so that
    you can feed the first coal and iron ore miners.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">As soon as you have produced 40 weapons, you should
    change your adjustments so that 60% of weapon production goes to bows and the rest divided
    to swords and spears. In this mission soldiers are only used for defense. Now it is time
    to concentrate more on the swamplands and to build up your manna production.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You should also occasionally have your soldiers promoted
    and set to defense.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In this way you should have no problems attaining the 600
    manna points you need.</font></td>
