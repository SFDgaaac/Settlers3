    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>SITUATION</b>: Our first attempt wasn't really much of

    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Because his comrades were still recovering from

    and keep the Amazons from overrunning his forces entirely.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Jupiter's response upon being awakened with the news was

    You begin at position (1) with a few soldiers and a lot of pioneers. The first thing you
    want to do is get as many of your settlers as possible safely to your basis in the south
    (3).&nbsp; There is, however, enemy land secured by guard towers between your starting
    position and your settlement. Put your settlers into groups and send the soldiers ahead
    since they can endure more than the pioneers when they are attacked by the enemy bowmen.
    You won't be able to get all your settlers to the basis safely but the more you get
    through, the faster you will be able to build up and defend the settlement.</font><font size="2"> </font><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Your soldiers will often be distracted
    along the way and try to attack enemy towers or enemy soldiers. Prevent them from doing
    this and get them to the south as quickly as possible!</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Problem</b>: </font><font color="#800000" size="2" face="Verdana">I keep getting overrun by the enemy!</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">If you have saved the game from the point where you have
    arrived in the south and you find yourself continually overrun after several attempts to
    defend yourself, it is better to start over at the beginning of the mission, trying to get
    more soldiers to the south safely. This will make the defense of the settlement later
    considerably easier!</font></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The best fishing spot is the bay of palms (4) to the west
    of the settlement.</font></td>
