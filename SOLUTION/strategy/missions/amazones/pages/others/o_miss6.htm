    another hangover, Horus manipulated the pliable Ch'ih-Yu (who was yet again unable to say
    &quot;no&quot; quickly enough) into teasing Q'nq&uuml;ra. Horus called it a job hardly worthy
    of Ch'ih-Yu's skill, but one that would certainly add to his fame. Still, Ch'ih-Yu
    hesitated, until Horus offered half an oxen to seal the deal. Horus's idea of teasing
    Q'nq&uuml;ra was to have Ch'ih-Yu shut down the Amazon's production of the Holy Gongs for good

    Don't get worried when you can't find your towers - you don't have any, at least not a the
    beginning. You only have some pioneers, soldiers, priests, thieves, geologists and a few
    cannons. </font><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The easiest approach here is to send your
    cannons ahead and fire on the towers. Use your troops to protect your cannons. If
    everything goes well, you be able to destroy all the towers without conquering them. You
    can then take the territory with your pioneers and get on with some settling.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You will find all of the necessary basic building
    materials in the storage areas, that is, where they were, or hidden in the woods. Get
    started at once producing enough wood and stone. On the mountain nearby you will find coal
    and iron ore (see map). Remember to keep your miners fed with enough fish.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In order to promote your soldiers, you will have to
    expand your territory to incorporate the small areas of swampland in the north. Use your
    pioneers for this. Then you can get started producing manna.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">From this point you have <b>three possibilities</b> for
    continuing.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The first possibility is &quot;the more, the
    merrier&quot;. You just recruit as many soldiers as you can and get them all promoted to
    their highest rank. Increasing their fighting strength will be difficult. Gold can only be
    found in a few small areas which are also difficult to reach.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The second possibility makes use of the sulfur deposits
    available. You can build a couple cannons which you can use to deal with the majority of
    the enemy towers and then you can capture the rest of the territory using your pioneers.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The third possibility is a combination of the first two
    along with the use of the tactic of surprise. You send almost all the cannons you produce
    as well as some 80 - 100 soldiers (the majority swordsmen and spearmen) through the
    middle.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The remaining troops are then divided between the two
    other ways.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now it becomes a matter of the proper coordination.
    First, only 3 large towers along the middle way are destroyed. Shortly before this, you
    should make sporadic attacks at the other two passages. In most cases all of the enemy
    troops will then rush to the buildings being attacked (there could be exceptions).</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now you can clear the way with cannons and leave only
    three towers around the gong halls standing (they should not be right next to eachother,
    otherwise the entire area will not be covered; ideally the north, southwest and
    southeast).</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">All that remains is capturing these towers.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Whether the last possibility works or not depends on the
    coordination of the troops sometimes. It is the most difficult but at the same time the
    fastest variant.</font></td>
