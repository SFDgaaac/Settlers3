    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>REPORT BY HELIOS</b>: I have never seen Jupiter as
    enraged as he was when he discovered one of his Roman governors had allied himself with

    face, despite her recent defeats.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I can't think of a plague or deluge or firestorm that

    to open for business.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In time we calmed him down and he put his apocalyptic
    plans on hold until the Amazons had been banished from the face of the earth. And until
    his loyal troops had crushed the rebellion, there would be no more miracles from him.</font></td>

    Actually, you have everything you need at your starting position. You don't have much
    room, though, for building your settlement. There is a mountain chain (1) in the west and
    some lakes in the east which can make expansion a little more difficult. </font><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The mountain in the east is helpful since it has enough and iron
    ore to keep you supplied at least for a while. There is also gold in sufficient quantities
    there. You should, therefore, first expand your territory to the east to take control of
    the mountain. You can then quickly begin producing tools and weapons. Build your smelting
    works and smith works (2) und (3) to the north and south of the mountain to keep the
    transport distances to the mines as small as possible. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">While the mines are being built on the mountain in the
    east, you should have some pioneers expanding your territory to the west where you will
    find another mountain and large supplies of building stone (4). This mountain in the west
    has only coal and iron ore, which makes it a suitable location for a second facility for
    weapon production.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The best fishing spots are the lakes, the
    northeasternmost of the four lakes is especially full of fish and a fisherman's hut is
    already built on its shore.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In this mission you can set up your defense so that your
    opponent has difficulties getting to you. Two positions are ideal. The first is the muddy
    terrain in your territory Here you can build a couple more towers on the western side and
    tear down the ones on the eastern side. At least a part of the enemy troops will be making
    their way through mud which will slow them down and give your bowmen additonal time to
    thin the attacking ranks.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The second position (6) offers a similar opportunity. In
    this case the terrain is swampland, but the strategy remains the same. Build the towers so
    that your bowmen can fire on and weaken the enemy as they come through the narrow pass.
    One of these alternatives should be sufficient. Both have the same function. You can shift
    your defense from one position to the other but this will require using more materials. If
    you have enough diggers and builders and plenty of wood and stone, there is no reason not
    to do this.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You should lead your first attack against your
    treacherous Roman countrymen because they are to blame that you can not use any spells.
    The Amazons should be left in peace for the time being. You should avoid having to battle
    on two fronts because many more soldiers would be necessary to do this. Fortunately the
    rebellious Romans in the north have the same handicap as you: they cannot use spells
    either and you are spared their damaging effects. The Roman soldiers attain their highest
    ranks quickly, though, and prove to be tenacious opponents. In spite of this, you should
    attack them head-on and continue to advance with a large group of soldiers (about 200) and
    completely destroy their colony. After you have eliminated the Roman menace, you should
    regather your soldiers and strengthen their numbers with soldiers you have recruited in
    the meantime. Remember that you now have spells at your disposal. For your attack against
    the Amazons take enough priests along with you because you will need them to fulfil the
    goals of this mission. You have to convert at least 10 Amazons so that they realize that
    their plan has failed and that you once again have&nbsp;Jupiter's magic backing you up
    again!</font></td>
