    wrath of Jupiter. Therefore, Jupiter sends us on a suicide mission: &quot;Take three
    towers and be quick about it!&quot; And then we are supposed to hold them for a while -
    against the superior strength of the Amazons.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>REPORT BY HELIOS</b>: Having uncovered Q'nq&uuml;ra's
    duplicity, my friends took to the offensive. Jupiter, still far too enraged to think
    clearly, was turned loose to charge ahead. His aim was to raise an outpost, then hold it
    against Penthesilea's Amazons. It was a daring move, but Jupiter was fighting mad...</font></td>

    Right at the very beginning you should get your thieves on board a transport ship and send
    them to a bay in the southwest of the main island (enemy territory). There you will find
    two storage areas which your thieves can plunder. </font><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">At
    the same time back on your home island you should expand your territory to the east with
    pioneers and build a medium residence to increase the number of pioneers. As soon as your
    pioneers have reached the edge of the forest, you can get started with your wood and stone
    production. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You can then have your geologist begin exploring the
    mountain for mineral resources. You should build 2 iron ore mines and 4 coal mines in
    suitable spots. You will also need to build up your food production (fish and bread),
    build an iron smelting works and works for your tool smith and weapons smith.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There are also 2 or 3 suitable places on the island for a
    winegrower. This will allow you to recruit your first promoted soldiers. It is important
    that you recruit new soldiers in the ratio of 50% bowmen and 50% a mix of swordsmen and
    spearmen (all of the soldiers should have the rank of sergeant).</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">As soon as your swordsmen and spearmen attack the first
    of the three towers surrounded by stone, your computer opponent will try to beat your
    troops back, but, here your bowmen come in handy. You should make sure that you constantly
    send reinforcements to the bay. Once you have managed to take control of the three towers
    surrounded by stone, you only have to keep the reinforcements coming in order to retain
    control of these towers.</font></td>
