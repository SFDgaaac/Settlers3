    (castles and guard towers, large and small) around the southern mountain. The area to be
    conquered is encircled by stones.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>DEFEAT CONDITION</b>: Your colony has been completely

    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You destroyed one of the guard towers you should have
    conquered instead.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>SITUATION</b>: No water, no wood. We will have to take
    evasive action. Supposedly, there is a mountain full of resources, forests and rivers in
    the south. It is going to be a long haul.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>REPORT BY HELIOS</b>: It was obvious to everyone that
    the Romans could not hold out forever against the Amazon's determined attacks. Soon they
    staged an orderly retreat, but by that time the Egyptians had managed to raise a
    settlement of their own without attracting the Amazon's attention. Unfortunately, Horus
    had not noticed the lack of forests and water...which may be what happens when you plan
    your strategy in a sandbox. Suddenly he had no alternative but to seize the mountain in
    the Amazons' southern territory.</font></td>

    Get off to a good start by converting 50 settlers into pioneers and expanding your
    territory to include the entire island. </font><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Because of
    the sparseness of trees it is important that you build 2 - 3 forester's huts at once.
    After that you should continue with 3 woodcutter's huts and a sawmill.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Next, you should quickly explore the mountain in the west
    for resources and see to it that there is enough food (fish and bread) for the miners.
    Choose the spots for your mines carefully (at least 3 iron ore mines and 6 coal mines).
    Your next building projects should be an iron smelting works and a tool smith's works
    because you will otherwise run out of hammers and picaxes.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">If you are careful selecting the locations, you can get 3
    - 4 weapon smith's works going at full capacity.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Keep in mind that the Egyptians need grain not only for
    producing bread but also for making beer. Build 2 more grain farms to cover these needs.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Try to get your manna production going as quickly as
    possible.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Take full advantage of the Egyptians' ability to increase
    their fighting strength quickly by building 3 gem mines.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Set your adjustments to recruit a 70% mix of swordsmen
    and spearmen (more than 80% fighting strength and sergeant rank). See to it that your
    troops are sent to attack the enemy towers in compact formations so that you can
    minimalize your losses.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You should continually make sure you have enough settlers
    by building large residences and enough soldiers by producing enough weapons.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The troops you send into battle should include at least
    25 soldiers that should attack 2 -3 towers at the same time.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The conditions for attaining victory should present you
    no further problems.</font></td>
