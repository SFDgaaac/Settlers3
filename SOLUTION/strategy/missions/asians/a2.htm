    have to worry about any attacks from the south. By building a castle and large tower, and
    manning them with bowmen, you&#146;ll be able to restore peace. You can then attack the
    your opponent in the east via your opponent in the south with an army of about 20
    soldiers. You can even attack from two sides&#133;</span></p>

    sent out the soldiers I had to look for the enemy, first to the south and then to the
    east. My first wary attempt at approaching the closest tower was immediately successful.
    The poor Egyptians, totally unprepared, must have assumed that their opponents were
    probably still far off. One tower after the other fell and then came the surprising
    message that I had won the game. In short, no new buildings constructed, no promotion of
    soldiers and yet the game won (Settlers Blitzkrieg?). To be recommended: set the lowest
    resolution with F1 (the individual soldiers can be controlled better with the mouse) and
    pull your injured soldiers out of battle!</span></td>
