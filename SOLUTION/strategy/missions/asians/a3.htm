    this mission it is important for you to get to the abundance of raw materials in the east
    and to prevent your opponent from doing so. Secure your supplies of building materials and
    expand to the east. To the west you can acquire some extra weapons by having a couple of
    your pioneers expand there. With these weapons and the gold you find in the east, the rest
    of this mission should be a piece of cake. There is not much space but you can do without
    pig farms since there is more than enough fish available.</span></p>

    mission is relatively easy. You simply have to find the weapons on the coast in the west
    and have them transported to the barracks (this happens automatically if you already have
    barracks). You will now be able to withstand the first attacks of your opponent and at the
    same time you have a good basic supply of weapons for your future army.</span></p>

    have to expand to the east to get to the mountain there. At first, you&#146;ll only be
    able to take a small area of the mountain because your opponent has already occupied a

    can vanquish your opponent. Ideally, you should attack him simultaneously on two fronts.</span></p>

    settlers available, which speeds up the construction of the following buildings. Next,

    there) and then to the east (towards the mountain). As a rule, your opponent doesn&#146;t
    tend to attack although his border in the north is very near. You can, therefore, build up
    your industry (don&#146;t wait too long!) in peace. Get started with the construction of a
    barracks early on since the weapons you find will offer you the basis for a powerful army.</span></p>

    tactics: in the east slowly and carefully move toward the enemy land in the northwest.
    Towers are only necessary on the border itself. Before attacking, you should build a
    healer&#146;s quarters on both borders. In this way you only need a relatively small
    attacking force that can capture an enemy tower and then retreat to the healer to be
    restored to full health. After a short time, your opponents are powerless against a war on
    two fronts and can do nothing more than watch their destroyed buildings go up in smoke.</span></td>
