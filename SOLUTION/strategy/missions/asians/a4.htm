    have to begin mining in the northern mountains immediately so that you can recruit as many
    soldiers as possible. First, you should build a sawmill and then a small or medium
    residence would be helpful.</span></p>

mso-fareast-language:DE;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">The
    two land bridges that separate your territory from enemy territory should each be secured
    with a large tower. Once you have a half decent army together (15-20 swordsmen, at least 5
    bowmen), you should capture the small tower that is near the outlook tower.</span></p>

    all of the soldiers you continue to recruit there. If you want, you can try to capture the
    area where the two large outlook towers to the east are located. This will deprive your
    opponent of sources for important raw materials.</span></p>

mso-fareast-language:DE;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">Now
    it is time to expand to the south. Take steps to build up your production of sulfur
    because your opponent has a castle that he keeps fully garrisoned. It is also necessary to
    build up your construction industry near the mountain. This will speed up development
    considerably and you will also free up a lot of space. Don&#146;t forget your production
    of manna!</span></p>

mso-fareast-language:DE;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">Once
    you have one or two fully loaded cannons with a protective escort of bowmen and spearmen,
    you should attack and destroy the castle. The castle is located across the land bridge to
    the east of the southern mountain. Your opponent has a huge supply of gems there that you
    should capture as quickly as possible. The rest is quite simple: Recruit and promote
    soldiers. Now you can literally overrun Ramadamses.</span></p>

    abundance of trees with four woodcutters. You could also use a sawmill and some more
    settlers. Then nothing should stop you from building up quickly.</span></p>

    the northwest and in the south there are enough mineral resources available. In the south
    there is also enough room for farms and other food production (after deforesting the
    area). The Egyptians will begin disturbing your building plans and attack mostly in the
    far north. The fewer opportunities your opponent has for attacking, the better his attacks
    can be repelled. For this reason, big towers and castles are not so important. Towers near
    the border, however, are of critical importance.&nbsp;</span></p>

    soon as you have enough new recruits and your supply of gold is in order, you can begin to
    take the offensive role. It is good to be aware that your opponent has his gold storage in
    the southeast: this can be more useful for you than for him.</span></p>
