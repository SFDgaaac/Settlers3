    2. Defense, 3. Offense. The first phase will decide the success of the entire mission.
    Speed is of the essence here. The most important thing here is the rapid build-up of a
    defense. There is relatively little space. Your main task consists in establishing a
    complete infrastructure without an extensive expansion of territory to the south. You
    simply can&#146;t afford to construct unnecessary buildings (mines are necessary). After
    tearing down all of your towers except those in the north, there will be enough room for
    the following buildings: a grain farm, a grain mill, an additional tower in the northeast
    (because the defeat condition is fulfilled if the small tower in the northeast is
    occupied), a bakery, a fisherman&#146;s hut, a shipyard, a tool smith&#146;s works, a
    weapon smith&#146;s works, a barracks and a large residence.<o:p> </o:p> </span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-bidi-font-family:Arial"><font face="Arial" size="2">The land in the west is a good place to build a landing dock after
    the land has been cleared. The following buildings have priority during the construction
    phase: tool smith&#146;s works (hammers become scarce quickly), weapon smith&#146;s works,
    barracks, fisherman&#146;s hut and a large tower.</font><o:p> </o:p> </span></p>

    the meantime, your geologists should find suitable locations for two coalmines, and one or
    two iron ore mines. These should be built quickly. Adjust your settings so that all coal
    and iron bars are brought to the weapon smith after one unit of coal and one iron bar has
    been delivered to the tool smith (all of the initial raw materials will be needed for
    producing bows). At the beginning, you can supply your coalmines as well as your iron ore
    mines with fish.</span></p>

    need a transport ship quickly to pick up the 8 soldiers on the neighboring island. Your
    two large towers and eight bowmen (full garrisons on all towers) should be able to hold
    off the first wave of attacks.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-bidi-font-family:Arial">In the second phase (defensive), you have to
    concentrate on getting control of the island in the north and the one in the south with
    your pioneers. Build a medium residence near the swamp. Then build a small tower on the
    land bridge to expand your territory, later a castle and two large towers.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Now it is time to recruit soldiers as quickly as
    possible (a lot of bowmen for the castle and two large towers). If your defense holds, you
    won&#146;t have to worry about the Romans any longer. When the offensive phase begins,
    your supplies in the north will be sufficient for defense and you can build a large temple
    on the island in the west and a small temple and a rice farm on the island in the north.<o:p> </o:p> </span></font></p>

    west can be added to your territory and there you can set up your food production. If your
    army is strong enough, you can take over the territory in the south by building towers.
    The Egyptians is the southeast are not as strong as the Romans &#150; you can make use of
    the raw materials of the Egyptians and attack the Romans with increased strength. Be
    careful. The Romans are very strong!</span></font> </p>

    the small island to the main island. There should be enough gold, iron and coal to build
    up a small, but strong army quickly. The first attacks from Septimus will not take long.
    The large supplies of fish will be adequate for the miners until bread becomes available.
    Next, you should build two large temples and promote your swordsmen. You can do without
    the production of spears entirely and should cut down on the number of bows. Once
    you&#146;ve withstood the enemy attacks with nearly no losses, you can first defeat
    Septimus and then Ramadamses.</font></span> </p>

    we have one of the most demanding of all the missions. After several attempts, I could
    solve this mission. Don&#146;t expand to the south! You should gather all of your
    soldiers, including those from the two small islands, on the border. You can tear down all
    unnecessary towers to free up soldiers. Because of time restrictions you won&#146;t be
