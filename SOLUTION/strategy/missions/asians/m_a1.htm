    iron, you are going to need lots and lots of stone. You are also going to need plenty of
    fish and iron, because later on, you will have to supply three islands with those goods.
    Therefore, it is a good idea to give the fish spell a try in the north, and to build some
    fisherman&#146;s huts there, too. Of course, you must not use the fish for food, but bread
    and meat instead. It is crucial to start upgrading your soldiers early, not only because
    of your defense, but also because of having to cast spells for getting iron. You should
    crush all guard towers except for the ones at the swamp (in your opponent&#146;s
    direction) to be able to concentrate your defense at that point. A hospital is sure to be
    of help here. Of course, you may get your first iron by casting the spell &#146;Heavenly
    Gifts&#146;.<o:p> </o:p> </font></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:Arial" lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">It is also important to build storage areas for stone and fish. You will also
    need a tool smith&#146;s works, a shipyard and a pier. You should also consider getting
    some donkeys along with a marketplace for transporting that stone to the grave.<o:p> </o:p> </font></span></p>

    that would only provoke your opponent. You should regard the western rivers as your final
    border. However, you can still finish this map without any trouble (except for your
    opponent&#146;s attack after approx. one hour). If you&#146;ve used the spell
    &#146;Heavenly Gifts&#146; one or two times, and have also built a barracks, you are very
    likely to have ten or more fully upgraded soldiers for your defense, which should be more
    than enough.</span></font> </p>
