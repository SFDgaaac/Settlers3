    of our trade ships carrying valuable shipments of rice wine have been seized by the Romans

    space plus some sulfur in the north. Everything is right there, waiting for you... except
    for a swamp for growing rice! What now? With soldiers at the rank of private you
    wouldn&#146;t stand a chance against your opponent: you would have to get something like
    300 or 400 soldiers over to his side, and that would be far too much of an effort, right?

    30 large temples. Once the priest has left the temple, you can crush it: you will get the
    manna anyway. With this (admittedly unusual) strategy you are still going to be able to
    recruit soldiers at the rank of captain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span></font>
