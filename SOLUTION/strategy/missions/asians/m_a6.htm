    briefing tells you to produce 120 barrels of rice wine rapidly. However, this is hard to
    accomplish before the blue opponent attacks, because the swamp lies far to the west and is
    heavily guarded by large towers and castles. In addition, once you have captured a couple
    of those towers, the blue opponent will immediately launch an attack, which you cannot
    possibly survive. Therefore, you should try capturing those towers only if you have plenty
    of high-ranking soldiers to secure your territorial gains. For this reason, you should try
    the &#147;Large Temple&#148; trick once again; you have plenty of space on the mainland.</span></p>

    a large army (approx. 300 soldiers) you should be able to capture and hold the towers near
    the swamp. Build some additional rice farms, distilleries, and three storage areas in the
    vicinity to produce and store rice wine. Once you have produced 120 barrels of rice wine,
    you will be the victor!</span></font></p>
