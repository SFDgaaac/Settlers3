Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;
mso-fareast-language:DE;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">difficult,
    but also very interesting mission awaits you. Four opponents, three of whom are going to
    keep attacking you, if you let them, surround you. In this mission, time is of the
    essence. You must recruit a vast number of soldiers, so you&#146;d better get started at
    once. Let&#146;s go!</span></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">1. </font><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;
mso-fareast-language:DE;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">Make
    sure you don&#146;t waste any space: you will have to build up a large economy. The
    mountains in the west and northeast contain more than enough resources. Start building
    distilleries around the swamp early and make offerings of the rice wine immediately. It is
    crucial to build up your largest colony ever as quickly as you possibly can. Save your
    game frequently to avoid having to begin from scratch.</span></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">2. </font><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;
mso-fareast-language:DE;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">Mine
    some more of the gold you find in the upper left mountain in the southern part of the map.</span></p>

Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;
mso-fareast-language:DE;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">You&#146;ve
    already recruited some soldiers at the rank of sergeant, right? You are ready to march
    against the Egyptians in the northeast, once you have about 50 soldiers at this rank.
    Those Egyptians have only weak defenses to protect their large stocks of gold and
    gemstones. The gold is quite handy when it comes to boosting your soldiers&#146; fighting
    strength. At this point in the game, the Egyptians do not yet have a large army, so you
    can inflict quite a lot of damage without enduring severe losses. If necessary, you can
    always send some newly recruited reinforcements. You should even be able to vanquish the
    Egyptians entirely, but beware: you are sure to attract some attention from your other
    opponents!<br>
    Crush all towers you capture immediately to free up more soldiers, and to avoid losing
    those towers to your opponents again. You wouldn&#146;t want to have to capture those
    towers all over again, right?</span></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">4. </font><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;
mso-fareast-language:DE;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">Heal
    your soldiers and keep recruiting new ones, who should be at the rank of captain by now.
    Once you have approx. 100 captains, you can attack the Romans in the northwest. Things are
    a bit more difficult here: lots of high-ranking soldiers and good defenses await you.
    However, your promoted soldiers should be up to the task. Keep sending newly recruited
    troops direct to the frontlines. Capture the towers one by one. Once you have finished off
    the Romans, you are free to deal with the south.</span></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">5. </font><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;
mso-fareast-language:DE;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">Now
    the rough times are over, so you can start recruiting a huge army. The Egyptians in the
    south are not much of a threat, and the second Roman tribe cannot attack you anyway.</span></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">6. </font><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;
mso-fareast-language:DE;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">The
    last Egyptian tribe can rely on great defenses: six castles and numerous large and small
    towers are waiting for your highest ranked soldiers. Make sure your fighting strength is
    higher than 100%.</span></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">7. </font><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;
mso-fareast-language:DE;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">As
    soon as you&#146;ve managed to get through the second Egyptian tribe&#146;s defenses, the
    last opponent in the southeast will already be waiting for you. Make sure to fill up the
    ranks of your army (250 soldiers, at least) before you engage your opponent!</span></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">8. </font><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;
mso-fareast-language:DE;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">Once
    you have recruited enough soldiers, all you need are priests: with the help of their spell
    &#145;Melting Snow&#146; you should create a passageway from the west into the
    Romans&#146; territory. Your soldiers will &#145;only&#146; encounter small towers, so you
    should be able to gain a foothold in your opponent&#146;s territory. Conquer the entire
    valley and build a large temple at its center. Victory is yours! Congratulations,
    you&#146;ve led the Asians home!</span></td>
