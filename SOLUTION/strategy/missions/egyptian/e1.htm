    embrace this new role, accept the challenge, and lead my new prison-state in order to

    woodcutter's hut and then a medium residence, a guard tower and a sawmill. Convert five of
    the settlers that come out of the residence into pioneers and send them to work in the
    west. You'll find gold near a shipwreck. The pioneers will capture the land containing the
    gold and the fighting strength of your small troop of soldiers will rise by about 9%.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Next, expand northward quickly and secure area
    in the mountains for mining mineral resources. Make sure you have access to the small
    deposit of gems there.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Now you can focus on your economy. Your
    computer opponent will soon be disturbed by your buildup and begin attacking your towers
    in the north. Just send the rest of your soldiers to the area and your opponent will flee.
    As soon as the fighting strength of your soldiers has risen to about 75% on account of the
    gems, build two pyramids so that you can promote your swordsmen (there is enough stone).
    Make sure you've already adjusted the entire production of weapons exclusively to swords.
    With an army of about 25 swordsmen you should have an easy time with your opponent.</font></td>
