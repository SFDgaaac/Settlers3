    During your (Ra) victory celebrations Tsu Tang (TT) has overrun wide expanses of the
    island. It's going to be a long, hard battle taking it back. While seeking allies, you
    found a small Egyptian pirate colony in the Southeast (P). As long as Tsu Tang is
    positioned between you, there's no alternative but to try to keep him at bay until you and
    the allied pirates are strong enough to attack the Asians.</font></p>

    <p><img src="../../../images/letters/o2.gif" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2" WIDTH="58" HEIGHT="58"><font size="2" face="Verdana">verwhelmed by the success of our campaign against the pirates, I
    became foolhardy. And I didn't anticipate the appearance of the Chinese, led by Tsu Tang.
    They have forced my hand early, but I should've expected it. Tsu Tang knows we are the
    better administrators, and that he can only wield his military strength as long as our
    wealth and resources are weakened. But we are caught like a mouse in a hole, and the cat,
    Tsu Tang, need only wait for us to come out. We must try to find another way...and try to
    enlist allies in our cause.</font></p>

    getting building material. Then you can build a medium residence. For your expansion it is
    important that you first advance to the south a little and then eastward. (You can create
    some great farmland from the swamps if you like). Send about 6 pioneers to the west to
    reach some deposits of iron ore that are worthwhile. If you keep the gem miners well
    stocked with fish, you will have enough gems to defeat Tsu Tang.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">If Tsu Tang attacks your ally who is often
    still quite weak, you can distract him by attacking one of his towers with a handful of
    soldiers. Normally, you won't have to promote your soldiers. If you have enough soldiers,
    victory is simply a matter of time.</font></p>

    strategy is to expand first of all to take away as much room as possible from the Asians. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The allies in the lower area of the map will
    do the same. Okay: first, get your building industry going, then you can build up your
    infrastructure in peace, since the Asians are not very fast and don't get their industry
    going particularly quickly. There will be some attacks from the Asians now and then but
    they will be rather half-hearted and don't represent any big danger. Gather your troops
    together (the ones you've had from the very beginning) and only attack the Asians when
    they are in your territory. Build a healer's quarters to avoid casualties among your
    soldiers. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">You can then begin mining gems from the
    southwestern part of the northernmost mountain. This will increase the fighting strength
    of your troops. By this time you should be getting additional soldiers. Don't bother
    mining gold. It doesn't help much. Gems are twice as effective.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I built a brewery, but promoting your troops
    really isn't necessary. As soon as you have about 40 soldiers, you'll be able to defeat
    the Asians in battle. (Actually, 30 are enough, but 40 is safer. It depends on your skills
    in battle).</font></p>
