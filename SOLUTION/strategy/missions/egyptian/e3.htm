    Your victory on the big island has earned you new territory and a new enemy(Ra). You
    landed on an unexplored island in Northwest. A strong Asian colony has formed in the
    Southeast (TT), they must be wiped out.</font></p>

    surprising intelligence and chose to side with us. But melding their economy into ours
    took time, and that we do not have in abundance.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Tsu Tang still worries me. The direct route to the
    strategic heart of this world crosses lands that he occupies, which we cannot yet fight
    through. We will have to move around to the Southeast, and although it is true that he is
    settling there, his base is still frail and more easily split. As ever, time is of the
    essence.</font></p>

    covers up valuable land for building. There are more than enough trees so you won't need a
    forester in this mission. In the south you'll find additional raw materials. Be careful
    about advancing too far eastwards because, if you do, your opponent will attack early and
    at this stage, you'll be greatly outmatched. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">In the south, fell all the trees you need to
    build up your heavy industry. You can then advance to the west when you have enough free
    settlers. Take land with pioneers. You'll find a lot of trees, mineral resources and land
    for building on the other side of the swamp. Promote your troops as early as possible by
    accumulating gold and gems. There are gems to be found but it is not easy.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">As soon as you have manna, you can have a
    priest drain the swamp and then you can construct more buildings to promote your soldiers.
    Your computer opponent promotes his soldiers quite early. If you've withstood all his
    attacks and have gathered enough soldiers together, you can begin with a long campaign of
    conquest. Attack your enemy first in the south where he has his temples and barracks.</font></p>

    before your colony is complete and before your production is in full swing, you can try
    the following strategy. After failing for the third time, I saw no other effective remedy.
    Gather all of your soldiers together &#150; you should have about 15 swordsmen. Move them
    to the east behind the mountain and attack. At the beginning of the game, there are three
    guard towers there. Your opponent is strong, but with a little luck you'll manage. My best
    time for getting through this mission is four minutes and 51 seconds.</font></p>

    should move to the south as soon as possible and then continue expanding to the east so
    that the Asians don't get control of the entire mountain area. Even when you do this,
    space is at a premium. Concentrate on increasing your troops as quickly as possible;
    promoting your soldiers is not absolutely necessary. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">As soon as you have 50-60 soldiers and also
    enough gems (at least 60% fighting strength), you can send a thief into enemy territory to
    find out where enemy soldiers are concentrated. Now look for a tower that is in such a
    location that the enemy soldiers have to pass through the mountains in single file (they
    cannot cross snow) to defend it. You can then weaken the enemy significantly if you have
    enough bowmen (about 15-20). Then, simply proceed from tower to tower to defeat your
    opponent.</font></p>
