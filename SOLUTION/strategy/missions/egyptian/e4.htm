    The Romans in the south (S) are very strong, and you (Ra) could lose all hope of advancing
    here--if Septimus Marius weren't having problems of his own with pirates (P), colonizing
    to his West. That will at least rob him of some precious time.</font></p>

    difficulty, as he should have expected. Our drive to the West may not be making much
    progress, but it may just weaken Tsu Tang enough for our movement in the South to meet
    with success. We must not hesitate!</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The southern islands are stable and prosperous, but there
    we confront a new enemy: the Romans under Septimus Marius. He has expanded his colony so
    far to the North that we will come into conflict with him soon. They are strong. We must
    hurry.</font></p>

    buildings have to be constructed on all three islands so that a supply of building
    materials is ensured.</font></p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The island to the far east has deposits of
    gems. The mining and storage of the gems takes place there while iron and coal are being
    mined on the island in the middle. Fishermen are sufficient for supplying your miners with
    food. All your soldiers can be transported to the island of your opponent using transport
    ships. In order to maximize the number of soldiers at your disposal, tear down all towers
    except one. If that is not enough, you can recruit more soldiers.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">If your soldiers have a minimum of 67%
    fighting strength, there should be no difficulties defeating Septimus. If enough of your
    soldiers are still healthy, you can also destroy the pirates right afterwards. It is
    important to keep your soldiers together and not let them scatter out. Speed is your ally
    in this mission because Septimus has poor prospects when you attack early and with
    strength.</font></p>
