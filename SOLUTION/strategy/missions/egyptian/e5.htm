    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>SITUATION</b>:<br>
    You'll (Ra1, Ra2) have to advance quickly to the west in order to avoid insurmountable
    resistance. Despite your still fragile infrastructure, you should not wait until Tsu Tang
    (TT) has secured his position.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You'll have to hold and strengthen your outpost, even
    though it will be difficult supplying it in the beginning. At the same time, while
    attacking Tsu Tang, you should to be prepared to face resistance from the Romans in the
    South (S).The Romans will not continue the fight once Tsu Tang has been defeated, they
    will pursue other goals.</font></p>

    advance to the West was in force - the conquest of the four islands there only a matter of
    time - when an unearthly thunderstorm shattered our three islands in the Southwest. After
    a frenzy of rebuilding, we have at least been able to resettle the northernmost of the
    three.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Septimus took advantage of the time we lost and pushed
    out to the North, and in the west Tsu Tang remains a menace. But we dare not lose heart,
    for we are better than both of them together. Their alliance cannot stand the test of
    time, and if Septimus cannot penetrate deep into the North, his position will be too weak
    to hold. If we can stop his advance, he will be ripe for negotiation. After all, he is a
    merchant at heart.</font></p>

    possible. Recruit 3 geologists and send two of them to the mountains in the north. There
    you'll find iron and coal. Send your third pioneer to the south. The small hill there
    offers a good place to build a gem mine. Gems are nearly always the key to victory. After
    you've gotten all of your soldiers to your opponent's island with a transport ship and
    they have a fighting strength of 75%, Tsu-Tang is done for. For more soldiers, tear down
    all your towers except one. That is it &#150; Septimus doesn't play a role in this
    mission.</font></td>
