    Tsu Tang (TT) remains firmly planted, as if nothing were happening in the northwest. He
    has entered into another alliance with Septimus (S). These two foes threaten to thwart
    your advance to the west once and for all.</font></p>

    between Septimus and Tsu Tang. Septimus took advantage of our short alliance by thrusting
    deep into the west, but to keep his northern flank free - and because my forces have
    become too much of a threat - he threw in his lot with Tsu Tang once more. They plan to
    crush us, and then turn on each other to determine a victor.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now we must break out and destroy the trades routes in
    the west, and we must attempt to drive a deeper wedge into the south. Against Tsu Tang I
    can only remain on the defensive. But the longer I can hinder his progress, the more his
    economic deficits bear down upon him....</font></p>

    Septimus is very strong at the beginning and is able to attack with a horde of troops in
    the first minutes of the game. Right at the very beginning, Septimus has to be weakened.
    Tear down all of your towers and gather your soldiers together. (Leave the castle
    standing!). While you are building up your infrastructure, send all your soldiers to the
    west and attack the first enemy tower. The following tactic has proved itself:</font></p>
    <ol>
      <li><p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Attack the tower and tear it down
        immediately after it has been captured.</font></p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Your opponent will send soldiers to the
        place where the tower stood. These soldiers will only defend themselves when they have
        gotten there. Therefore, you have to do everything possible to ensure they don't get
        there.</font></p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Repeat this tactic with every enemy tower.</font></p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">During your attacks, always move westward
    splitting the land into two parts. Destroy the temples and the industry surrounding the
    first mountain. After you've managed this, you'll have about 10 soldiers remaining. Now it
    is time to retreat. Have your healer restore your soldiers to full health and man your
    castle completely. If Tsu-Tang launches an attack (this seldom happens), he has to attack
    the castle, but he'll fail miserably. After you've recruited more soldiers, you can deal
    Septimus the death blow.</font></p>
