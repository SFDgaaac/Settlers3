    The land is very mountainous, and it will be difficult growing crops on your rocky islands
    (Ra1, Ra2). Initially, gathering resources will be equally as difficult. Two small,
    fertile islands in the Northwest (B, C) could help you with your food production problems.
    A large, mineral rich island to the West (A) should help you with building up your
    resources. Be mindful of the Asians, Tsu Tang (TT) has established an outpost nearby. It
    must be destroyed.</font></p>

    woodcutters and then a sawmill. Pioneers can expand your territory over the rest of the
    island. On the small island in the north, you can build a gem mine on the small hill. Tear
    down all of your towers on the main island so that you have more space.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">With a coal mine and iron mine, an iron
    smelting works and a shipyard, you'll be able to transport soldiers from both islands to
    the big island. Your miners can get along quite well with fish. The island can be quickly
    taken with some 40 pioneers. Your opponent often blocks his own way so that he cannot
    expand further. If not, you simply have to proceed quickly. You'll find weapons, building
    materials and gold as you go along.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Build a barracks on the new island and have
    weapons delivered from your main island. You now have to gather enough soldiers together
    with a fighting strength of 57% (if you prefer more fighting strength, you'll have to see
    to getting more gold or gems) in order to rid the island of your opponent. Finally, towers
    have to be built on the two small islands.</font></p>

    stonecutter's hut, awoodcutter's hut and a sawmill. On the other island (Ra2) build a gem
    mine in the middle of the mountain. Back on the other island (Ra1), have a geologist
    explore the mountain in the middle of the island. After all the construction is complete
    on the island (Ra1), you can tear down the tower to the west. Build a shipyard a little to
    the south and then you'll need a landing dock, an iron mine, a coal mine and an iron
    smelting works. If trees become scarce, be sure to build a forester's hut. The landing
    dock building should be built where the tower previously was. Use two pioneers to gain
    more space to the north. If you also expand a bit toward the south, you'll find a couple
    gold bars.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Once the shipyard is finished, build a
    transport ship and then a trade ship. Use the transport ship to take the carriers from on
    the island (Ra2) to the island (A) after converting them to pioneers. Begin taking island
    (A) from the north because you'll find weapons and gold there.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Now you're ready to transport all the soldiers
    from the island to island (A). When all your soldiers are on the island and you have the
    gold in your possession, begin capturing as many towers as necessary from your opponent
    who has settled in the south of island (A) until there are no more enemy mines in
    operation. By building a barracks and a medium residence on island (A), enough new
    soldiers will become available so that you can conquer the rest of the island. Islands (B)
    and (C) can then be taken with pioneers. All the tools you'll need for building there can
    be transported to the island with your trade ship.</font></p>
