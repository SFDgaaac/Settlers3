    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>SITUATION</b>:<br>
    You are on the brink of victory, but of the three warring parties, you (Ra1-Ra5) have the
    worst starting position. On the main island to the West you have been able to establish a
    bridgehead (Ra5). It is seriously being threatened by Tsu Tang (TT), who is very strong in
    that area. Septimus (S), who is in the South, has a more vulnerable position than Tsu
    Tang, but is still very resilient. Defend your outpost, obliterate Tsu Tang, and wipe
    Septimus from the face of the map. </font></p>

    but that is also true of our foes. Septimus remains the weaker of the two, but even he may
    be stronger than we are. Still the greatest danger lies with Tsu Tang - well entrenched
    and nearly unassailable on his two islands, with an impregnable fortress at its strategic
    core. If Septimus and I join in battle, Tsu Tang will certainly deal a death blow to the
    defeated, and then there will only be two. I must lead an attack against Septimus - it
    must be swift and hard. Hard enough to get Tsu Tang to play the hangman I cannot.... Hard
    enough to give me a chance to hang the hangman....</font></p>

    First, you should put a stop to gold production since there are enough gems. Production of
    weapons should be suspended, too. Certain tools are needed far more urgently. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Now, build a shipyard on the easternmost
    island to build transport and trade ships. The first transport ship can take all your
    soldiers to the outpost and new soldiers can be recruited on the main island. Again, tear
    down all towers except one. When your soldiers have reached a fighting strength of 85%, it
    doesn't matter if you've managed to promote your soldiers. (All of Septimus' soldiers have
    the highest rank from the very beginning). With a large army you can first conquer
    Septimus and then turn your attention to Tsu-Tang. He is not very strong and is also
    weakened by frequent attacks from Septimus. Septimus, on the other hand, becomes
    progressively stronger with time and has a lot of soldiers. Your army should be able to
    defeat approximately 400 enemy soldiers (all of the soldiers you have from the beginning
    and an additional 60 recruits should be enough if you attack early).</font></p>
