    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>SITUATION</b>:<br>
    Prevent the establishment of a common border between the Romans and Asians in the north.
    In order to ensure a lasting rule over this island, you should completely destroy one of
    the tribes. There is an abundance of resources and land in your area, especially in the
    east. A small island is worth visiting there.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>STORY</strong>:</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><img src="../../../images/letters/w2.gif" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2" WIDTH="58" HEIGHT="58"></font><font size="2" face="Verdana">e knew the storm was coming, we could see
    it, stalking us like prey. The nagging fear lasted for hours. The horrible scraping of
    wood on rock, the ship tossed against the waves, and then fear disappeared. We knew it
    meant death for us all. And when death did not come, the fear grew again, the fear for a
    life already believed to have been lost. The storm raged another two days, but our ship
    remained cradled in the reef, neither sinking nor capsizing. Then yet another night came.
    Soaking wet, chilled to the marrow, we were menaced only by the deathly stillness
    following the once raging storm. No one had any idea where we were. And then - morning.
    The island. Like an invitation to paradise, fertile, green, with a sea full of fish.But
    that's what paradises are: much sought after. And we are probably the third group battling
    for this Garden of Eden. Although the two tribes in the north are obviously not on the
    best of terms, our presence will surely unite them. We must try to drive a wedge between
    them.</font></p>

    form a common border. Even after three hours of play, this won't happen. You should,
    nevertheless, hurry since your enemies, especially the Romans in the northwest, will be
    attacking constantly.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">1.Get your grain production going early so
    that your manna production is in full swing later.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">2.The small mountain contains enough mineral
    resources at the beginning, but later you'll have to exploit the resources in the mountain
    chain in the north. There you'll also find gold deposits in the east.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">3.Once you've recruited a few soldiers, you
    should build two castles near the route where the Romans will launch their main attacks.
    Make sure that both castles are finished at the same time! Then you can repel the attacks
    of the Romans with fewer losses.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">4.Make use of the far-off supplies of stone
    because, otherwise, you'll have too little in the way of building materials.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">5.Concentrate on promoting as many of your
    soldiers as possible to their highest ranks. Thanks to the gold deposits, they should have
    a fighting strength of about 70%. As soon as you have some 250 soldiers, attack the
    Romans. Make sure that the Egyptians don't enter the fray at this point by tearing down
    the towers you've captured at once. With the complete destruction of the Romans the
    mission is finished!</font></p>
