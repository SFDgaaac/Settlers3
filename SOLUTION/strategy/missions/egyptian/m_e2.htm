    The Egyptians are located northeast of you, and are protected by a land bridge which
    separates you from the Romans. Because stone is scarce in your area, your ally will ship
    you stone by caravan after a while. In return you should provide them with iron and/or
    weapons, so that they can defend themselves.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">If possible, you should try to keep the Romans occupied
    with attacks from the sea to hinder their invasion of your ally. A strategically clever
    pinpoint attack could be very effective, but only with sufficient manpower and a little
    divine assistance.</font></p>

    our homeland. Along the way, we found another island, where a group of our countrymen was
    colonizing. Stranded themselves, they could offer us no new information about our
    whereabouts. They are under heavy pressure from a Roman colony in the north.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">They have very little iron and have asked us for help.
    They offered, in return, to help us with gathering stone.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Our thief's reports confirm that only together will we
    stand a chance against the Romans, if we have a chance at all, that is. We are greatly
    outnumbered, and will surely need help from our god, Horus.</font></p>

    be enough for two settlements! For the most part, the Romans will leave your ally in
    peace; they will be concentrating their attention on you. Your first priority is to
    protect yourself. You should only deliver goods to your ally when you are in a position to
    do this safely.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">1. Thanks to the large supply of stone from
    your ally, you can build up a large colony quickly. Build several grain farms so that you
    can promote your soldiers quickly.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">2. The two mountains offer all the mineral
    resources you need. Produce as many gold bars as you can.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">3. Once your soldiers are promoted, crank up
    your recruiting. Supply your ally with some iron ore so that he can arm his troops better.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">4. 200 soldiers should be enough to defeat the
    Romans in most cases.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">5. If you have already build a large
    residence, a sphinx and pyramid in the meantime, the defeat of the Romans means you've won
    the mission.</font></p>
