    Speed is important in this mission. You have to defeat the pirates in the west quickly and
    then destroy the Romans. After that, you must capture the pirate groups prowling around in
    the southwest and get them to the inactive volcano crater with the burial grounds. At
    least ten pirates must be captured, before we can hope for any information from Horus
    regarding our whereabouts. Horus is, however, more than ready to help you get your
    opponents to the volcano crater. Remember not to kill all of the pirates; ten of them are
    needed as sacrificial offerings.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>STORY</strong>:</font></p>
    <p><img src="../../../images/letters/t2.gif" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2" WIDTH="58" HEIGHT="58"><font size="2" face="Verdana">he search for our homeland continues. We seek clues - and find
    hardship.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">A detachment was sent out along with some building
    materials so a newly found island could be colonized. A couple soldiers remained behind to
    guard the outpost, and the rest returned to gather the workers needed. But when we
    returned, we found the watch guards murdered, our storage pits plundered and burned.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The island is apparently full of rival pirate factions,
    one of them, settling in the west, newly enriched at our expense. Retaliation is our
    creed. We owe at least that much to our slain comrades. Revenge will be ours, although we
    can't expect any support from the Romans in the southeast.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">One of our spies has intercepted a message from a pirate.
    It spoke of a place of worship in the southwest. Located on holy ground, almost
    unreachable by foot, it is said to have been a burial ground for thousands of years; a
    place of dark rituals, priestly summonings, and sacrifices. A place offering answers but
    demanding human sacrifice. Maybe we'll find our answers there.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">May Horus be our guide!</font></p>

    dangerous. Concentrate on recruiting a lot of soldiers quickly. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">1. At the beginning you have nothing more than
    a few soldiers. The Asian settlement in the west is only weakly protected. Attack the
    Asians. You'll find everything you need there.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">2. Expand your territory near the starting
    point with pioneers so that the smith is in your new settlement. Tear down all towers
    except for the southernmost large tower. Man this tower completely.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">3. You'll find coal and gold in the mountain
    in the west, iron ore in the small mountain in the east.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">4. Recruit soldiers early and set up your
    manna production. Increase your fighting strength. Position all of your soldiers at the
    large tower at once. This can prevent your enemy from attacking.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">5. Obtain new mineral resources in order to
    recruit a lot of soldiers quickly. Once you have 200 soldiers at the highest rank and with
    a fighting strength of about 75%, begin your attack.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">6. Now for the pirates&#133; You'll find two
    craters in the southwest. There are a group of pirates in the one to the south. March into
    the crater with a priest. When the pirates storm toward your priest, have your priest use
    the spell &quot;Banning Foes&quot; to transport them to the other crater. Repeat this
    spell until 10 pirates have been transported there.</font></p>
