    THE WORLD</strong></font><p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>VICTORY CONDITION</b>:<br>
    Destroy all Asian rice farms and distilleries.<br>

    Your colony has been completely destroyed.<br>
    Your enemy accumulates 500 Points of Manna.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>SITUATION</b>:<br>
    A powerful Asian colony has developed in the north, and they are experts in the production
    of manna. It is therefore necessary to completely destroy the enemy's production by
    leveling all his distilleries and rice farms. In order to be able to hold this territory
    for the long term, a castle must be built in the center of the swampland.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Your scouts haven't found any larger supplies of building
    stone in the south of the island, but they overheard Asian guards speaking of a land where
    stones spring from the virgin soil.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>STORY</strong>:</font></p>
    <p><img src="../../../images/letters/h2.gif" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2" WIDTH="58" HEIGHT="58"><font size="2" face="Verdana">orus has answered.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We must find the formation of two circles, called the Two
    Eyes of the World. We must offer sacrifices there to open the gate, which will take us
    home.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Unfortunately, he neglected to tell us where we could
    find these two eyes. And our problems at the moment are less of a religious nature and
    much more of a secular one. We have too little stone for building, and the Asians in the
    north have too many soldiers for us to threaten them. If we don't act quickly, they'll
    wipe us out easily and we will never behold the eyes of the world.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Asians offer generous sacrifices to their god,
    Ch'ih-Yu, regularly. He is powerful, a god of war, and our chances are slim if we can't
    cut off their manna production soon. We have to find stone, and lots of it. We have to
    take possession of the swamplands in the north to defeat the Asians.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Then we can turn our attention to the Two Eyes of the
    World.</font></p>

    but in this mission you have a bit more time. Nevertheless, you should hurry because your
    opponent will have no qualms about attacking you.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">1. Building stone is a little scarce; there
    are large deposits in the south of the main island. Build a castle next to the large tower
    in the west. This will offer you additional protection.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">2. Try to get your manna production going
    quickly. Promote your spearmen first!</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">3. 1. Exploit the mountain in the west. There
    you'll find gold as well as other mineral resources. With the gold you should be able to
    increase your fighting strength to about 70%.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">4. Build about four transport ships and fill
    them with soldiers at the rank of sergeant. Set the soldiers ashore north of your
    settlement. Capture all of the towers along the swamp so that all of the enemy
    distilleries and rice farms are destroyed.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">5. Even if you are unable to destroy all of
    the buildings, you'll no longer be in acute danger. Continue with similar attacks until
    you've reached the mission goal.</font></p>
