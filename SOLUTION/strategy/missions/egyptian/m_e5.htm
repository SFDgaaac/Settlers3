    Your colony has been completely destroyed.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>SITUATION</b>:<br>
    Here two Asian nobles and their followers divide the land. Both are well versed in
    defending themselves against infantry attacks and have taken the necessary precautions.
    The Asian colony in the southwest has considerable supplies of gems and gold, which you
    should get your hands on as quickly as possible! In the northeast, behind the other Asian
    colony, there is a Circle of Stones, which the Asian priests consider to be of immense
    magical significance. Take and secure this holy area with at least ten soldiers of the
    highest rank and who have a fighting strength of at least 90%.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>STORY</strong>:</font></p>
    <p><img src="../../../images/letters/w2.gif" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2" WIDTH="58" HEIGHT="58"><font size="2" face="Verdana">e now have an idea of what we are looking for, and what is meant
    by the Eyes of the World. One of our priests had a dream the first night on this island.
    Since then he has had the same dream seven times: two pyramids on an island and the voice
    of Horus, speaking out of them:</font></p>
    <p align="center"><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana">One eye beholds ten soldiers,<br>
    The Eye of the Wolf shall be blind,<br>
    Four watery eyes as the watcher of winds,<br>
    Two smiling eyes victors shall find.</font></strong></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Far to the east there is a Circle of Stones. That may be
    the first of the eyes mentioned. We will dispatch our troops to take a closer look.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><img src="../../../images/letters/o2.gif" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2" WIDTH="58" HEIGHT="58"><font size="2" face="Arial">nly the Asians in the northeast will attack you.
    The ones in the south have no access to important raw materials. Coordinate your defense
    accordingly.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">1. You won't find a whole lot of resources in
    the small mountain. Expand quickly to gain control of the big mountain in the southeast.
    There you'll also find gold./font&gt;</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">2. Protect your colony by building two castles
    next to each other as soon as you've recruited your first soldiers. Promote your soldiers
    to the highest rank during the course of the game.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">3. Make sure you get adequate supplies of gold
    and can produce manna.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">4. Once you have about 200 soldiers, attack
    the Asians in the west. In order to destroy the castle, which is surrounded by a moat,
    you're going to need ballistas. Build about three or four of them.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">5. Using the gold in the area previously
    controlled by the Asians, you can increase the fighting strength of your soldiers to about
    90%.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">6. Now on to the second Asian tribe. It would
    actually be easy to defeat the Asians in the south since they mainly have small towers.
    Unfortunately, many of their towers are not accessible to your soldiers because they are
    located on small islands. This generally is a case for the ballistas but the matter is
    complicated because the Asians have forests everywhere. To overcome this difficulty,
    you'll have to enlist the skills of your priest, unleashing a forest fire to clear the way
    for your ballistas. Then the Asians will be sitting ducks for your ballistas.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">7. Wait until the fighting strength of your
    soldiers has increased to 90% and then send 10 of your soldiers to the ring of stones in
    the far northeast. The mission is then successfully concluded.</font></p>
