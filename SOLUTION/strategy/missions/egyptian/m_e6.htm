    A Roman commander has settled in the southwest. His task is protecting the large temple,
    which is essential to his priests. The Romans are well secured, but you must destroy this
    temple at all costs! You must also capture the coast in the northeast of the island, which
    is rich in fish. This shore area is beyond a small strip of desert and can be easily
    identified by an ancient fishing boat lying there. There is a problem, however. To get
    there and be able to build a fisherman's hut you must pass through an Asian settlement.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>STORY</strong>:</font></p>
    <p><img src="../../../images/letters/o2.gif" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2" WIDTH="58" HEIGHT="58"><font size="2" face="Verdana">ne eye beholds ten soldiers -- this part of the prophecy has been
    fulfilled. A portal opened and brought us to another island. Here we are charged with
    finding the Eye of the Wolf and blinding it. A thief has reported that a peninsula in the
    southwest houses a Circle of Stones, with a Roman temple within it.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Apparently it is this which must be destroyed to blind
    the eye of the wolf. In the northwest, we have sighted huge schools of fish along the
    coast, near an old dilapidated fishing boat. We should make use of this bounty, even
    though the Asians colonizing nearby will probably not be happy about this.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">1. Exploit the resources that you find in the
    mountain in the southwest and the one in the north. There are gems in the mountain in the
    north.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">2. Leave only the one large tower standing
    because your two opponents have you sandwiched in. Make sure you build up your colony
    quickly. Thanks to the gems, you can increase the fighting strength of your soldiers
    quickly. Don't be stingy with your offerings of beer to Horus!</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">3. Defend the northern mountain against the
    surge of expansion from the Asians by building a castle on both sides of the mountain.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">4. Once you have about 200 soldiers, attack
    the Asians and destroy them if possible. This is not absolutely necessary, but it is
    better not to have an enemy at your back.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">5. There is a fisherman's boat far in the
