    OF THE WINDS</strong></font><p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>VICTORY CONDITION</b>:<br>
    Build a guard tower on each of the islands, which is surrounded by a small circle of water
    in sand. These are on the periphery of the main island in all four compass directions.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Destroy one of your enemies. You have the choice.</font></p>

    Your colony has been completely destroyed.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>SITUATION</b>:<br>
    You must destroy at least one of your enemies. This will not earn the respect of the other
    tribes, but the area you settle and your riches will be so great - provided you're
    skillful enough - that your enemies will possibly refrain from attacking.Finally, you must
    build the four guard towers, the four watchers of the wind.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>STORY</strong>:</font></p>
    <p><img src="../../../images/letters/t2.gif" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2" WIDTH="58" HEIGHT="58"><font size="2" face="Verdana">he Eye of the Wolf has now been rendered sightless. We spent a
    long time contemplating the third line of the dream prophecy. Now that the spies have
    returned with more information, our priests have been able to decipher the message. We
    understand its meaning; even if what we see is not to our liking.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We are now in the middle of an island surrounded by four
    hostile tribes. To keep them in line, we have to show military might and destroy one of
    them.</font></p>
    <p align="center"><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana">One eye beholds ten soldiers,<br>
    The Eye of the Wolf shall be blind,<br>
    Four watery eyes are the watchers of winds,<br>
    Two smiling eyes victors shall find.</font></strong></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We have discovered the four watery eyes. They are small
    ring-shaped lakes with water shallow enough to be waded through. Because there is a wind
    for each direction, we assumed winds were meant here and that in each wind or direction, a
    lake was to be found. According to the divinations of our priests, we must build a guard
    tower on the island in the middle of each of these lakes.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><img src="../../../images/letters/t2.gif" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2" WIDTH="58" HEIGHT="58"><font size="2" face="Arial">his mission is very similar to the eighth Asian
    mission, except that here <b>all</b> four of your opponents will attack you if you don't
    prevent them! Speed is everything!</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">1. Tear down all your towers except one large
    tower and position your soldiers in front of it.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">2. At the beginning, use towers to expand, but
    tear them down immediately afterwards. You'll find gold and a rich deposit of gems in the
    far north of the long mountain chain. This will allow you to increase your fighting
    strength.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">3. Get an early start on your manna production
    so that you can recruit at least spearmen at the rank of sergeant. In general, you should
    build up a very large colony so that you don't need to wait too long for supplies.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">4. Once you have some 50 soldiers, primarily
    spearmen and swordsmen, you should attack the Asians to the south of your mountain. This
    will give you quick access to more mineral resources. Tear down all of the towers you
    capture because your enemies to the west will intervene otherwise. To avoid having to
    reconquer everything once again, leave the castle of the Asians in peace for the time
    being. Limit yourself to weakening your enemy and pushing him back.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">5. When you think the Asians are weak enough
    and your army again numbers about 100 soldiers (ideally with some soldiers at the rank of
    captain), you can turn your attention to the Romans in the northwest. By this time, the
    Roman army will be quite large. Be prepared for some hard battles. You should be able to
    weaken the Romans considerably. Don't give in until the Romans are destroyed!</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">6. Next on your agenda is a second group of
    Asians in the southwest. First build up the size of your army. Now you have the worst
    behind you. The second group of Asians have a large army but consists mainly of privates.
    Your more highly promoted army should have no problems with them! As soon as your opponent
    has been polished off, you can look around for a place for your towers.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">7. Finish off the weakened Asians!</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">8. And for the final, step there are the
    Romans in the north. They haven't been very visible. Count on the Romans having loads of
    soldiers, but with 200 of your own you'll have no problems dealing with them.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">9. The locations for the towers, which are
    enclosed in a ring of water are in the middle of the path connecting your former
    opponents. Build a tower in each of these locations, four altogether, and you are then
    ready to embark on your final mission</font></p>
