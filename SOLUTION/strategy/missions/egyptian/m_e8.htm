    Your colony has been completely destroyed.</font></p>

    You are confronted with two highly developed opponents. Your position is weak, and that
    must be changed as quickly as possible. If you manage to destroy your enemies, to take
    possession of the two Circles of Stones, one in the northeast and the other in the
    southeast, and to build pyramids there. Then and only then will Horus be satisfied with
    you.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>STORY</strong>:</font></p>
    <p><img src="../../../images/letters/t2.gif" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2" WIDTH="58" HEIGHT="58"><font size="2" face="Verdana">he prophecy has nearly been fulfilled. After building the four
    watchers of the winds, we came to the island of the Two Eyes. But they haven't been
    brought to smile. Far from being victors, our tribe has been torn into two, and without
    word from one another, we have begun building colonies.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Luckily, our spies have happened on one another, and our
    vision has improved. We must reunite our tribes, we must find the two eyes and we must
    build pyramids within them so that Horus, the winged one, will carry us home.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><img src="../../../images/letters/t2.gif" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2" WIDTH="58" HEIGHT="58"><font size="2" face="Arial">he last mission is once again a challenging one.
    Your two opponents have far more raw materials than you do, and will recruit a imposing
    number of soldiers. You'll have to be fast!</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">1. There is coal on all four mountains, but
    iron ore is scarcer. You'll find some in the mountains in the northeast and the southwest.
    The mountain in the northeast also contains some deposits of gems and the one in the
    southwest has gold deposits. There is an abundance of stone. You should build several
    stone cutter's huts.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">2. Connect both of your settlements as quickly
    as possible.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">3. In order to defend yourself against both of
    your opponents, you should produce a lot of manna and recruit soldiers quickly. Gather all
    of your soldiers together in front of your only tower. Mine gold and gems at the same
    time.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">4. Promote your soldiers. Build three castles
    in the middle of your two settlements, each in shooting distance of the other. Your bowmen
    should be promoted to the rank of captain.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">5. Recruit at least 400 soldiers. Once their
    fighting strength is at 80%, attack both of your opponents at the same time, using 200
    soldiers against the one opponent and 200 against the other opponent. By attacking both at
    once, you can destroy both enemy armies and aren't in danger of having your settlement
    destroyed by one opponent while you're attacking the other.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">6. You probably won't have enough soldiers to
    destroy both enemies. Send newly recruited and healed soldiers to the battles on the
    fronts. Make use of raw materials that you've conquered from the enemy to get fresh
    recruits as quickly as possible.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">7. In due course you should be able to defeat
    both your opponents.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">8. Now, you only have to build the two temples
    in the rings of stone. Build a marketplace near each of the rings of stone. As soon as
    you've built both large temples, you have won! Truly an impressive performance! You can
    now count yourself as a true Settlers III champion!</font></p>
