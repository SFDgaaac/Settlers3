    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>DEFEAT CONDITION</b>: Your colony has been completely
    destroyed</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>SITUATION</b>: Unfortunately, coal resources are very
    limited, but as a Roman, you have an alternative source for securing coal. This new oasis
    is not big enough for both you and the Egyptians. Jupiter will not listen to the prayers
    of your priests, except they be the only voices he hears. It will be necessary to
    completely destroy your newfound enemy.</font></p>

    <p><img src="../../../images/letters/i2.gif" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2" WIDTH="58" HEIGHT="58"><font size="2" face="Verdana"> have traveled Mare Nostrum and have visited the lands of the
    dark-skinned giants, where the sun lies in the north at noon. I have visited the Islands
    of Bliss, and the Pillars of Hercules have seen me more often than my wife. But never have
    I encountered a storm such as this. In all my days and travels I thought I knew every
    island in Mare Nostrum, but alas I have no idea where we are. I don't even recognize the
    stars here. But curse Neptune I will not, for he has led us to fertile soil and a
    beautiful land.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Beauty is often coveted, and we have heard that an
    Egyptian settlement in the north has laid claim to this land as well...Our spies have
    reports of a holy oasis far to the northwest. Perhaps we will find answers there.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><img src="../../../images/letters/t2.gif" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2" WIDTH="58" HEIGHT="58"><font size="2" face="Arial">he first mission is already quite a tough one.
    Charcoal maker's huts (you should have at least ten) are as crucial to your success here
    as is the smooth building up of your economy. It is also important to get your manna
    production going as soon as possible.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">1. Begin this mission just like most of the
    other Settlers missions: provide building materials by building a stonecutter's hut, two
    woodcutter's huts and a sawmill. Expand your territory by building small towers. <b>Caution</b>:
    In this mission (as in most of the other ones) you have to deal with a very aggressive
    opponent. Do NOT expand your territory too fast by building plenty of small towers, for
    that is only going to provoke your opponent, who's military strength is far superior to
    your own at the beginning of the game. It is better to leave only <b>one</b> single tower
    standing and to crush all other towers as soon as they have been occupied. A <b>single</b>
    tower is always easier to defend and will always attract less attention than several
    towers. Still, you can build some watchtowers later on to keep an eye on your territory.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">2. Build a medium residence and scout the
    western mountains. You are bound to find plenty of gold and iron, but there is hardly any
    coal and it can only be found in two places. However, you should still build some
    coalmines there.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">3. Continue building up your economy just as
    usual. Once your food production and your industry are in full swing you should focus on
    the production of manna.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">4. Possibly, you have already been attacked by
    your opponents at this point. However, you should have been able to repel those attacks
    with the soldiers you started with and the ones you have recently produced. In any case,
    you should build a hospital: it will be a great help.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">5. Now the coalmines will no longer produce
    much, so you will have to start building charcoal maker's huts. To keep a charcoal maker's
    hut going it takes approx. one sawmill, two woodcutter's huts and one forester's hut.
    There is plenty of space for those buildings in the west and east.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">6. By now your manna production should be
    flourishing, so you should be able to produce soldiers at the rank of sergeant. Keep on
    building charcoal maker's huts until you have about ten of them. Once you have soldiers at
    the rank of captain, you should build a castle in the east next to the border of the
    superior yellow opponent. Later on you should build a second castle. Fill those two
    castles with soldiers and they should be able to withstand any enemy attack. Depending on
    the behavior of your blue opponent you should consider building one or two castles next to
    his border.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">7. Now that you are safe from your opponents'
    attacks, you can concentrate on building up your army. Mine gold until your troops'
    fighting strength has reached approx. 70%.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">8. 200 soldiers at the rank of captain should
    be enough to attack and vanquish your yellow opponent. Depending on your troops'
    condition, you can move straight on to the blue opponent and vanquish him, too. All you
    have to do now to win the mission is to conquer the northern oasis by building a tower at
    its edge.</font></p>
