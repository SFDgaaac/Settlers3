    <p><img src="../../../images/letters/t2.gif" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2" WIDTH="58" HEIGHT="58"><font size="2" face="Verdana">he priests have showed us our way north to another island. It is
    equally unfamiliar to us and not nearly as fertile. Vast deserts stretch through the
    north, and our priests will have to work great wonders to get our crops to grow here.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Still farther north, a fellow Roman colony has been
    spotted, but the oracle forbids us from making peace with them. We are supposed to conquer
    this land, and it is also time for us to pay homage to Vulcanus. We must gather 100 iron
    bars for the tribute.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">If I only knew what was going on here. We are like
    puppets to the gods, and know not what they have in store for us.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><img src="../../../images/letters/y2.gif" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2" WIDTH="58" HEIGHT="58"><font size="2" face="Arial">our most important units are now the pioneers: with
    their help you should claim the northern mountains, where you will find plenty of much
    needed resources such as iron, coal and gold. Instead of using donkeys to transport food
    to the mines and bring the resources back to your settlement, you should create a narrow
    corridor with your pioneers to connect the mountains and your settlement. Here a couple of
    things to keep in mind:</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">1. At first, expand your territory by building
    towers, but remember to always crush any tower you've just manned with a soldier. A single
    tower will be enough for now.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">2. Expand your settlement rapidly and build
    residences to create more Settlers. Turn some of those Settlers into pioneers and let them
    claim the area mentioned above from your settlement to the northern mountains.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">3. Thanks to the various goods lying around on
    this map, you can begin producing soldiers even before you have built your first mine.
    Those soldiers are quite handy when it comes to defending your settlement against any
    possible attack.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">4. Once again, remember to produce manna at an
    early stage in the game! If you do not have much room to build the necessary buildings,
    use magical spells to turn the desert into arable soil.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">5. Thanks to the northern mountains, which you
    should have claimed by now, you now have plenty of resources to start recruiting more
    soldiers. In the meantime, you should have accumulated some manna to begin promoting your
    soldiers. Speed up your production of goods by building two iron smelting works and two
    weapon smith's works. Of course, to keep your production running smoothly, you will also
    have to build some more coalmines. You can speed up the promotion of your soldiers by
    building four small temples and five to six wineries.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">6. Keep mining gold until your troops have an
    fighting strength of approx. 80%.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">7. With an army of approx. 200 fully promoted
    soldiers you should be able to defeat both of your opponents in a single battle.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">8. All you have to do now is produce 100 iron
    bars!</font></td>
