    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>SITUATION</b>: A small Roman colony is seeking your
    help and has settled to the north of the large stone field. There are no natural sources
    of iron available to them, and they will certainly perish without help. Even wood and
    stone are in scarce supply there. Make sure you provide them sufficient support and drive
    out the Asians before you or your ally are annihilated.</font></p>

    drove us to yet another unfamiliar coast. Soon after landing, a cry for help from a small
    Roman settlement reached us. They have been under attack from a menacing Asian tribe for
    weeks. We had no choice but to help them. Our priests believe they will share information
    about our homeland if we succeed in helping them.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><img src="../../../images/letters/y2.gif" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2" WIDTH="58" HEIGHT="58"><font size="2" face="Arial">ou can ignore your ally for the moment: he is more
    than able to defend himself. You should only intervene if your opponent attacks your
    ally's castle. Tip: your ally's hospital can heal your troops, too!</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">1. In this mission it is once again a good
    idea to leave just a single tower standing. By doing so, you will attract less attention
    from your opponent. This is important for building up your economy in time before your
    opponent starts attacking you. You will find plenty of gold, iron and coal on the mountain
    in your territory.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">2. You should start producing huge amounts of
    manna as soon as you can!</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">3. Wait until you have defeated your opponent
    before you send resources to your ally!</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">4. In the meantime, your ally will have lost
    some of his towers. You don't have to worry about that right now, but do NOT try to
    recapture those towers immediately! In most cases, your opponent will be satisfied with
    capturing a few of your ally's towers. However, at some point he will attack you, too. By
    then you should have produced enough soldiers to fend off his occasional attacks.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">5. Increase your fighting strength to approx.
    80-90%. Once you have approx. 250 soldiers (level 3) you should make your move and attack
    your opponent!</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">6. As soon as you have defeated your Asian
    opponent, start delivering iron bars, some coal and some weapons to your ally. He is going
    to expand his territory rapidly now and will start recruiting soldiers soon. Once he has
    100 soldiers, you have won.</font></p>
