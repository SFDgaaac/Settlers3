    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>DEFEAT CONDITION</b>: Your colony has been completely
    destroyed.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>SITUATION</b>: Your goal is to take possession of the
    Circle of Stones in the north. You have a little time to do this, since your immediate
    neighbors show little interest in expanding their territory. They are, however, guarding
    the narrow passage to the northern half of the island.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>STORY</strong>:</font></p>
    <p><img src="../../../images/letters/w2.gif" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2" WIDTH="58" HEIGHT="58"><font size="2" face="Verdana">e found a seafarer's map in an old mining tunnel buried deep
    within the mountain. Only one other island is depicted on it, and it is in the shape of an
    hourglass. Since the Ring Island had no other information to impart, we have left it
    behind.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There is said to be a holy place there, far to the north
    of the new island: yet another Circle of Stones. It is a gate to another world, and
    perhaps our passage home.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">But before we can attend to those matters, a couple of
    Egyptians need our attention, since they stand directly in our way.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><img src="../../../images/letters/t2.gif" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2" WIDTH="58" HEIGHT="58"><font size="2" face="Arial">his is by far the most difficult mission you've had
    to face so far. Your opponent starts attacking you early with plenty of soldiers, and once
    again you hardly have any coal to speak of. Yet again, the &quot;Keep only one tower&#148;
    strategy is the key to victory. Luckily, you only have to deal with a single opponent on
    this map, for the yellow opponent is not going to build up a colony of his own. He only
    has six large towers and a couple of soldiers.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">1.Keep building small towers in the east and
    west until those two small mountains are in your hands. Remember to crush all towers once
    you've manned them with a soldier, and leave only your first tower standing. Once the
    mountains are yours, expand your territory with pioneers only.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">2.North of the two mountains you will find
    some coal, and there is also some iron to be found in the south. Keep on mining coal until
    there is nothing left.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">3.Build up your economy quickly, but don't
    forget about the manna! You must produce soldiers as soon as you can: the higher their
    offensive strength, the better for you!</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">4.Gather all your soldiers around your only
    tower. This will prevent your opponent from attacking. You have been lucky, if he hasn't
    attacked you by now. However, you should still build a healer's quarters.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">5.Now that there no more coal to mine, it is
    time to start building charcoal maker's huts. By now your pioneers should have claimed a
    lot of land in the east. Despite the fact that most of this land is thickly covered with
    trees, you should use foresters to ensure that your charcoal makers (you should have
    approx. six) have always enough wood.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">6.There is some gold to be found in the
    western mountain. It's not much, but every little bit helps. You can use the 'Midas Touch'
    to gain an fighting strength of approx. 70%. Start recruiting a huge army consisting of
    fully promoted soldiers, conquer the six towers held by your yellow opponent, and leave a
    full complement of soldiers in each tower. Thanks to the gold and coal you now have
    looted, your soldiers will feel great! However, the other Egyptians will not respond
    kindly to this latest &quot;acquisition&#148; of yours and will strike soon. Nevertheless,
    your soldiers should now be able to deal with any attack.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">7.Recruit some more soldiers and heal your
    wounded. Now you should be able to take the circle of stones in the north</font></p>
