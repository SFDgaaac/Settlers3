    <p><img src="../../../images/letters/w2.gif" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2" WIDTH="58" HEIGHT="58"><font size="2" face="Verdana">e stepped through the portal into a new world , and suddenly we
    could get a glimpse of a plan that shrouded our journey. Our new lands are called the
    Winelands, for we dicovered a great wine, a variety we are not familiar with. Jupiter has
    instructed our priests to offer generous amounts of this wine in the Circle of Stones in
    the north.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Well, big wars have broken out with considerably less
    cause.</font></p>

    resources in this mission. However, the problem is to actually FIND them! Huge mountains
    surround them; the only gap is in the north. Exactly south of your starting position you
    may find some iron. A little bit to the west from there you may find some gold, and some
    coal in the east. Another source of coal lies to the west of your starting position. Again
    you have to deal with a very aggressive opponent, so it's a good idea to crush all newly
    built towers once a soldier has manned them. Build a tower as close to the mountain as
    possible and claim the rest with pioneers.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">1.Once you have found the resources start
    building up your economy. As soon as you have enough soldiers you should build a castle in
    the north and man it with a full complement of soldiers. Build a second castle right next
    to the first one to protect your border effectively against all possible attacks.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">2.Remember to produce manna. Admittedly, it's
    quite hard to produce any on this terrain&#133; The only place to grow wine is along the
    river in the north.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">3.Since there is plenty of gold in the
    mountains it should be easy for you to upgrade your soldiers' fighting strength to approx.
    80%.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">4.Your opponent is not a pushover. To beat him
    you must have quite a large army of soldiers at the rank of captain.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">5.Once you have built the temple in the circle
    of stones, all you have to do is produce 200 manna points, that is, if you haven't
    produced that many already. Every line under the miracles in the Settlers menu symbolizes
    10 manna points.</font></td>
