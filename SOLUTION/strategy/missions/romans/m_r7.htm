    <p><img src="../../../images/letters/j2.gif" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2" WIDTH="58" HEIGHT="58"><font size="2" face="Verdana">upiter has not yet gotten enough wine, or at least he is not
    willing to tolerate our enemy having large amounts of the precious drink stored in his
    territory. We must seize these supplies for Jupiter and at the same time smelt 150 bars of
    gold for him.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yet there is no gold to be found here. In the northwest
    there is said to be gold deposits in a large mountain. But, first of all, we have to get
    there. Our enemy is blocking the way.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">One of our spies, though, maintains that there is a
    footpath through the muck...</font></p>

    flats to reach the resources in the northern mountains. However, there is an easier way of
    getting resources: just send your geologists to the eastern mountains!</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">1.Build up your colony and promote your
    soldiers early.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">2.Those eastern mountains will provide you
    with enough resources for a while. In addition, there are coal and iron lying around all
    over the map. Claim the territory around those resources with your pioneers.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">3.Luckily, your opponent will launch his first
    attack against you quite late in the game. If you begin producing manna early you should
    be able to produce soldiers at the rank of sergeant soon. Send a small squad of soldiers
    to your opponent to take away his mountain. Remember to SAVE your game first!</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">4.You should be able to capture and hold the
    towers around the mountain. Use pioneers to create a narrow path between the mountain and
    your colony. Now you can really start recruiting soldiers.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">5.In any case, build a castle next to the
    mountain and man it with a full complement of soldiers. You should also move the rest of
    your soldiers to the mountains; you wouldn't want to lose it, right?</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">6.The loss of his mountain should've
    substantially weakened your opponent; he shouldn't be much of a problem now.</font></p>

    this mission!</font></td>
