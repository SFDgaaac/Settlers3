    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>SITUATION</b>: Although your goal lies in the west,
    you must first deal with stabilizing your own situation, since you can expect strong enemy
    contact on the main island in the west. In spite of this, you must be strong enough at the
    end to overrun the western island and to find the crystal sea.</font></p>

    <p><img src="../../../images/letters/j2.gif" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2" WIDTH="58" HEIGHT="58"><font size="2" face="Verdana">upiter is satisfied, and has led us to an island that, hidden
    behind high mountains and protected by zealous natives, is the gate to our homeland - a
    sea as clear as a mountain stream.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">At present, though, we have numerous other problems: very
    scarce supplies of raw materials and too little space to expand. We have to explore the
    surrounding islands. In the north there is said to be a lot of land and an abundance of
    resources.The way home, however, lies to the west.</font></p>

    this campaign. To get some resources you should conquer at least one of the two islands in
    the northeast. Remember to build another castle on your outpost to make sure that you
    won't lose your foothold on that island (and the mission!).</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">1. Take your time. Since there are not many
    resources to be found on your islands you should build a trade ship and a transport ship
    before building a tool or a weapon smith's works. Otherwise, you won't have enough iron
    bars for building ships.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">2. Take the neighboring island with approx. 20
    pioneers. The mountain on that island is bursting with resources: gold, iron and coal. Get
    those goodies to your main island and deliver food to your outpost in return.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">3. Keep on producing gold until your fighting
    strength reaches approx. 90%.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">4. You haven't forgotten to produce manna and
    weapons, right? Transport those weapons to your outpost, which still exists, thanks to the
    second mountain. Build a barracks and two large residences to recruit approx. 200
    soldiers. This should be enough, for only one of your opponents has built a proper colony.
    No problems here&#133;</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">5. As soon as you have defeated your blue
    opponent you can start capturing the castles around the lake and finish this campaign.</font></p>
