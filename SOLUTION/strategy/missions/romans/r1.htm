    right? So take your time: start by slowly building up your timber industry (one forester,
    two woodcutters and one sawmill), then have a look around for some stone, expand your
    settlement, and find some more resources. Go on by building up your food production, and
    then build some mines.</font></p>

    it's possible to 'rush' this map right at the beginning by launching an immediate attack
    on your opponent with all of your soldiers. To do this, simply gather your soldiers
    together, send them up to the northwest, and let them attack first the one enemy tower,
    then the other. Since your opponent is still very weak at this point in the game, he
    cannot defend himself against your attack, and will lose the mission. However, as this
    strategy of immediate attack ('rushing') will no longer work later in the campaign, you
    should use this mission to get acquainted with the game instead. Since you are never
    really in danger of losing the game in this mission, you are free to experiment a little
    bit.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">First, you should build up a proper building and
    construction industry. Build a forester's hut (next to a forest, of course), two
    woodcutter's huts (build one forester's hut for every two woodcutter's huts), a sawmill
    (next to the woodcutter's huts), and a stonecutter's hut (next to some stones, of course).
    &nbsp; You should also build a medium residence (small residences are too ineffective!) to
    make sure you have enough Settlers. Actually, you should keep an eye on your number of
    Settlers during the entire game, and build some more residences from time to time (later
    in the game, you may also build large residences, for they are even more effective than
    the medium ones). Furthermore, you should always make sure you have enough space for
    expanding your colony. Basically, there are two ways of expanding your territory.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The first one is to build towers. The disadvantage here is
    wasting valuable building materials for the tower's construction, and ordering off a
    soldier to occupy the tower. Of course, you can crush the tower immediately after the
    soldier has moved in (the land will stay yours), but keep in mind that you always must
    have at least one tower; otherwise, you will lose the game instantly.</font></p>
    <p><img src="../../../images/letters/t2.gif" alt="t2.gif (1090 Byte)" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2" WIDTH="58" HEIGHT="58"><font face="Arial" size="2">he second way to expand your territory
    is with pioneers. Of course, you must have some unoccupied Settlers before you can recruit
    pioneers. Send your pioneers to your borders and let them claim new territory. With both
    of these ways of expanding your territory, you should keep in mind that your opponent may
    also quite easily claim any land (with pioneers or by building towers or castles), which
    is not in the vicinity of a tower or castle.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">After getting your building and construction industry
    going, you should focus on building up your food production and heavy industry (the latter
    next to a mountain). You should also start growing wine to be able to upgrade your
    soldiers' fighting strength later on. Build the wineries in the vicinity of hills or at
    the foot of green mountains, and, for best results, select the working area to be either
    on a hill or the green part of a mountain (never build anything on those wine growing
    areas!) Don't forget to build a couple of small temples, where you can get manna points by
    making offerings of wine (keep your transport routes short!). Once your heavy industry is
    up and running (incl. the production of gold and weapons), you should build a barracks for
    recruiting soldiers. Please note that you'll need some unoccupied Settlers for this, too.
    If you think you're finished playing around, let your troops attack your opponent to win
    the mission.</font></p>
