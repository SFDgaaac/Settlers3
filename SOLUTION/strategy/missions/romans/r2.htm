    an alliance with a horde of pirates from the West. We must quickly retake the island and
    secure the coasts, and then we must break out to the sea. The sea, where I am at home. I

    trade! You may easily be playing this mission for hours before you find out how to build
    ships and transport goods with them... Your Settlers are spread out on two islands: the
    main island (nobody can attack you on that island, which is why one tower is enough) and
    the island which is going to become the main battlefield.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">At the beginning you should build a residence
    on each of your islands (preferably a medium-sized one). Expand your territory with
    pioneers only. On your main island you should get your timber industry going as quickly as
    you can. Build a shipyard, then a transport ship and finally a trade ship. Of course, you
    should get the production of food and the mining of resources going too, including
    smelting works, smith&#146;s huts, barracks etc..</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Later on you can also build a vineyard and a
    temple.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Save resources by not expanding your territory
    on the outpost island by building towers. Instead, turn your new arrived Settlers into
    pioneers and keep on expanding: first to the west until you reach the border, then to the
    south.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Start sending over soldiers from the main
    island as soon as you have established a ship route between the two islands. Start
    building a trade ship now. In the east and south of your outpost try to reach the small
    land bridge, build a tower there and man it with a full complement of soldiers. That
    should keep an easy opponent like the one on this map at bay!</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Now start having your woodcutters chop down
    the woods on the outpost island. You should also start mining resources and producing food
    (build mines, farms etc.). Now start producing plenty of soldiers on your outpost, and,
    soon, you will be ready to strike</font></p>

    game is over once you lose your outpost on the western island. You should try to build a
    transport ship as quickly as you can (shipyard!) to get all of your soldiers from the main
    island to the outpost.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Don&#146;t worry about your main island being
    attacked: the computer-controlled opponents in &#147;The Settlers III&#148; never build
    ships! The first opponents to attack you are the Roman pirates in the south. However, just
    like the opponent in the north, those pirates are not very strong, which makes an early
    attack on them quite easy. Do not wait too long before attacking your opponent in the
    north either, because the more time he has, the stronger he gets. Still, for a very long
    time he will be quite easy to beat. Remember to transport enough soldiers from the main
    island to your &#145;outpost&#146;; two or three transport ships are recommended.
    Don&#146;t forget to build residences on your main island on a regular basis. Otherwise,
    all your carriers will be turned into soldiers and your economy will collapse rapidly!</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">By the way: you should try your hand at
    transporting goods across the sea in this mission.</font></p>

    territory with both pioneers and towers. Woodcutters will then make room for buildings.
    There should not be any problem finding enough stone. An iron smelting works and a
    shipyard will make sure that you will be able to build enough transport ships for
    transporting all of your soldiers to your outpost. You don&#146;t have to have more than a
    single tower on your main island. There is plenty of space for farms in the south, so
    providing your miners with food shouldn&#146;t be a problem. Fishing, however, is hardly
    worth the effort, and you don&#146;t need pigs if there is enough bread.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Expand your outpost and look for gold in the
    north to boost your soldiers&#146; strength. Two fishermen at the west coast should be
    sufficient for a gold and coal mine each. Once you feel strong enough (60% or more) you
    can strike against the pirates (yellow). They shouldn&#146;t be much of problem. After you
    have recruited some more soldiers you can deal with the blue opponent&#133;</font></p>
