    <p><font face="Verdana"><b>SITUATION</b>: Hard on the heels of Remigius, you have made
    your way north (S1) and are now confronted with a new dilemma. A well-secured pirate
    island (P), as well as Remigius' weakened colony (Re) stands united; apparently he has
    allied with a nearby Egyptian settlement, under the rule of someone called Ramadamses
    (Ra). Your outpost (S2)will need to be well fortified, if you expect to survive this
    enemy. In order to demonstrate your peaceful intentions to the pirates, you have declared
    the desert island (W) nearby as neutral territory.</font></p>

    Flavius - live on an island to the North. Flavius respects our strength, but I don't
    believe he fears us. As long as Remigius remains a threat I have no use for war with him,
    so I have declared the small island between us taboo - a bond of security for us both. I
    would be surprised if Flavius violated this bond as long as it serves him well.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana">The coward Remigius has found his last refuge in the distant
    Northwest. The Egyptians, under Ramadamses, have settled to his East, and they are
    supporting him. It seems that behind Ramadamses' artist's mask skulks a wily fox, intent
    on playing Roman against Roman....</font></p>

    sufficient building materials, build a fisherman&#146;s hut, a coalmine and an iron mine.
    Once you have a tool smith&#146;s works on your outpost island you can consider it
    independent from the main island. Once your offensive strength has reached 60% or more
    (soldiers should have been promoted at least once), and you also have enough soldiers, you
    should strike against Ramadamses (green). Afterwards, you should us your transport ships
    to transport your remaining soldiers to the yellow opponent&#146;s territory. In most
    cases, he should be very easy to beat.</font></p>

    main island and an outpost. Therefore, the first basic steps should be quite clear:</font></p>

      <tr>
        <td width="100%"><font face="Arial" size="2">build a medium residence on your main island<br>
        turn some of your Settlers into pioneers to conquer the surrounding land<br>
        build up a complete economy (incl. mines, iron smelting works, tool smith&#146;s hut,
        temple) </font></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">It is crucial to build a shipyard early to be
    able to build a transport ship and, later on, a trade ship and some more transport ships.
    You also have to establish a trading route between your two islands. Just like on your
    main island, you should build a medium residence on your outpost island, and then turn
    some of the Settlers into pioneers to conquer the island quickly. Again you should expand
    your territory on the outpost island only until you reach the land bridge, and secure your
    territorial gains with a guard tower. Once you have established a trading route between
    the two islands, start transporting goods to your outpost. However, it is even more
    important to get some soldiers over to your outpost! Feel free to go on expanding your
    territory once you feel safe enough. Still, it is NOT necessary to expand your
    territory&#133;</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">I&#146;ve continued building transport ships,
    packing them with soldiers, sending them to the outpost, and eventually got rid of
    Ramadamses. With the rest of my soldiers I landed on the small island in the northwest and
    vanquished my opponent there. If the game is still going on you also have to beat the
    pirates. It&#146;s a good idea to start the attack on the pirates by sending some soldiers
    across the land bridge. Once the battle is in full swing you should land about ten
    transport ships full of soldiers on the other side of the pirates&#146; territory, thereby
    encircling them.</font></p>

    your main island to produce soldiers quickly enough.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">You won&#146;t find much stone on your main
    island. Therefore, you should build two stonecutter&#146;s huts on the outpost island, and
    transport the stone over to the main island. To supply your gold mines on the main island
    with fish you can also import it from the outpost island. However, you should make sure
    that there are enough stones left on the outpost island, while at the same time enough
    wood is imported from the main island. Otherwise, you won&#146;t have anything to erect
    buildings with! </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Once your offensive strength is between 70%
    and 80% you have a good chance of defeating your opponent in the northeast with 20 or 30
    soldiers. First you should cut his territory in half to weaken his economy before dealing
    with the two parts one after the other. Make sure you always have enough swordsmen to
    occupy the towers you conquer. When all else fails, you can crush recently conquered
    towers to free up more swordsmen.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">To vanquish the other two opponents send seven
    transport ships full of soldiers to the two islands up north. Conquer the northernmost
    island first, and then deal with the pirates.</font></p>
