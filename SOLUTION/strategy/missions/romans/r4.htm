    tries to conquer the archipelago which we control. But the wily fox even now penetrates
    into the west, trying to put a hammer to our colony from that position. When we moved to
    escape his trap, we ran into more Roman pirates, and they are unfortunately less
    reasonable than Flavius.</font></p>

    his people have joined with us. I give thanks to Jupiter that he has guided this man to my
    side. Flavius is a gifted commander and his men are fiercely loyal - and they are pirates.
    They will know how to deal with the Roman pirates... and then Ramadamses' Egyptians will
    fall into my trap, and I will do them in....</font></p>

    <p align="left"><img src="../../../images/letters/a2.gif" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2" WIDTH="58" HEIGHT="58"><font size="2" face="Arial">t the beginning you should focus on expanding your
    territory and producing building materials (stone). Ideally, your territory should stretch
    from the western mountains to the eastern ones. You should expand your territory to the
    north until you reach the bay where a lot of stones are waiting for you.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Once you have three stonecutter&#146;s huts,
    four woodcutter&#146;s huts, two sawmills and one forester, it should be easy to acquire
    gold and weapons quickly. If you are not satisfied with the quantity of stone you find at
    the northern bay, there is still more to be found in the south.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">As long as your castle is still standing, you
    may safely crush all of your towers. By doing so you not only gain valuable building
    materials, but you also force your opponent to concentrate his attacks on the castle.
    However, if your opponent&#146;s territory is getting too close to your own, you should
    quickly build some towers to avoid territorial losses.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">There is plenty of room for farms, but,
    considering the time it takes the grain to grow, you should build grain farms at an early
    stage. You should take advantage of the fact that just west of your castle the sea is full
    of fish. Use land you can spare for wineries to increase your offensive strength.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">You can easily repel smaller attacks. The
    opponent who strikes first against you is sure to be the first one to be destroyed. (The
    blue opponent has often piled up quite a lot of gold, which makes attacking the yellow
    opponent later on easier.)</font></p>

    eye on the northern border separating them from the opponent in the east. That is going to
    be attacked quite frequently at the beginning. For that reason you should place all of
    your troops near that border. It is a good idea to build a castle near that border to make
    your opponent think twice about attacking you there.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Once your economy is up and running, and you
    have produced a sufficient number of (strong!) soldiers you may risk attacking your
    opponent in the north (your eastern opponent). As soon as you have vanquished him you can
    start attacking the pirates, which should be easier, now that you can attack from two
    sides (south and east). Quite soon, there shouldn&#146;t be any trace left of those
    guys...</font></p>

    <p align="left"><img src="../../../images/letters/f2.gif" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2" WIDTH="58" HEIGHT="58"><font size="2" face="Arial">irst of all, there are two things to keep in mind:
    the map shown in the briefing is not correct (the starting positions S and P swapped
    places), and you better forget about those tips you've read in the briefing or in games
    magazines. This mission is very hard, especially for beginners who try to quickly expand
    their territory to the north and northwest to build up a &quot;normal&quot; economy: they
    are bound to be attacked by both opponents and will lose the game in no time.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I suggest you do NOT expand your territory, especially NOT
    in your opponent's direction. That way you will gain valuable time to prepare for the
    first couple of attacks your opponent will launch against you.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Try this: build two woodcutter's huts, then two fisherman's
    huts, a storage area and a medium residence. Send a few geologists to the mountains in the
    east. Crush the castle, for it takes up precious space, but don't touch your towers. Now
    you have some time to make the following menu adjustments.</font></p>
    <p><img src="../../../images/letters/i2.gif" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2" WIDTH="58" HEIGHT="58"><font size="2" face="Arial">n the 'Transportation Priorities' menu select fish to be stored, and
    in the menu 'Distribution of Goods' set fish to approx. 2/3 coalmines and 1/3 iron mines
    (for the production of weapons you will need exactly twice as much coal as iron). Finally,
    set 20 bows in the 'Tools and Weapons' menu at the highest priority (of course, you also
    have to recruit 20 bowmen!). To be able to actually produce those weapons you have to
    build a coal and an iron mine (your geologists should have found something by now!). Now
    you should start building an iron smelting works, a weapon smith's works and barracks. To
    avoid running out of building materials you build two woodcutter's huts, a sawmill and a
    stonecutter's hut. Soon the first couple of bowmen will gather in front of your barracks.
    Now you can start erecting a defense perimeter consisting of guard towers from the north
    to the northwest, which have to be pretty close to one another. Your 20 bowmen are enough
    to man ten towers (plus a swordsman for each tower, of course). You should also gather the
    rest of your soldiers behind those towers. Now your opponent is more than welcome to try
    his luck at breaking through: you are well prepared!</font></p>
    <p><img src="../../../images/letters/a2.gif" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="2" WIDTH="58" HEIGHT="58"><font size="2" face="Arial">fter you have survived the first attack waves (with a little bit of
    luck your bowmen will strike so much fear into the hearts of your opponent's troops that
    they won't even dare attack!) you should simply go on building up and strengthening your
    economy. North of your defense perimeter there is enough space for two or three grain
    farms. Build up a complete food production cycle now. Expand your territory by sending
    pioneers to the west and east. Keep on building more mines and start producing gold and
    manna. Make sure to send all the fish to the gold mines ('Distribution of Goods' menu).
    Increase your production of soldiers by building a tool smith's works (to get more
    hammers), more iron smelting works and weapon smith's works.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Once you have enough well trained soldiers and your storage
    areas are filled with gold, you can launch an attack on Ramadamses (yellow). It's a good
    idea to start the attack from the east and destroy the Egyptians' barracks. After your
    victory over your yellow opponent you can attack your blue opponent from several
    directions. He should not stand a chance, and your troops should be able to finish him off
    in no time.</font></td>
