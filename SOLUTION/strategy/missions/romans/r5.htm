    colonies (A1, A2, A3) have been spotted to the North, each struggling for control over the
    other. None of these tribes appear to be under the rule of the ruthless warrior Tsu Tang
    (TT), who I hear is gaining power.</font></p>

    next step we will rule the entire southern realm of this world. If we are careful, we will
    become so powerful that Ramadamses - and now also the Chinese under Tsu Tang - will have
    no alternative but to submit to us.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">But I am mindful that our position is not yet secure. The
    pirate's island is rich in raw materials, but poor in food, and I do not believe that Tsu
    Tang - or Ramadamses, - who is planning his revenge far in the northeast - is prepared to
    negotiate. We may already be too strong for that.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">A group of three islands in the north could supply us
    with a bounty of food, but Tsu Tang is aware of them, too. Good that Flavius has been able
    to capture part of the pirate fleet, because we must be quick: if we can succeed in
    isolating Tsu Tang's islands from one another, we'll cripple his chance for victory.</font></p>

    gold bars, you've lost the game. For that reason you should crush your castle, the large
    tower and all guard towers but one. Now you should have enough building materials to start
    producing your own gold soon.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Conquer the entire island and chop down the
    small forest in the south. Start producing weapons and tools, and build a large temple. As
    soon as the large temple is finished, you can speed up the grain's growth once. After
    that, the large temple is useless and should be crushed. Two weapon smith's works should
    be enough, make sure to build three transport ships. Attack the opponent with the biggest
    gold reserves first. Since every one of your opponents has a large number of soldiers,
    your troops must have a fighting strength of at least 70% to stand a chance. Concentrate
    all available troops outside the opponent's territory, and then begin your attack. (Most
    of the time your orange opponent has quite a lot of gold. After you have dealt with him,
    strike against your yellow and green opponents).</font></p>

    the Asians (red) in the north. There is hardly any space on your main island, but it is
    enough to build the essential buildings. The land bridge in the south is an ideal location
    for building farms. To save space on the main island you should store your gold reserves
    on the small, uninhabited island in the northwest. You should also recruit your soldiers
    on that island to prevent all of your carriers on the main island from being turned into
    soldiers (there is plenty of room for new residences on the small island). Since the
    fighting strength of your opponent's troops is very high, the key to your victory lies in
    outnumbering those troops.</font></p>
