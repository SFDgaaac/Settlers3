    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>SITUATION</b>: Your two colonies (S1, S2) separated by
    the sea are still very weak from the war. The Egyptian colonies have been devastated by a
    recent volcanic eruption. You have to stop Ramadamses (Ra) from transforming his
    archipelago into a fortress.</font></p>

    island group, and had even managed to drive Tsu Tang out of his two more northern islands
    when a volcano erupted in our midst, devastating all of the islands in the north. Only a
    small colony in the northwest remains.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Ramadamses took advantage of the disaster to advance from
    the northeast and occupy the island group. He then began assisting Tsu Tang's beleaguered
    island and so forged an alliance.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">But Ramadamses may be slinging the noose around his own
    neck. If he curries favor with Tsu Tang in the belief that he can use this dangerous
    warrior for his own purposes, he is in for a surprise. Even if he manages to defeat us
    using Tsu Tang as the sword, he will himself be impaled on the blade. Ramadamses should
    have remained a sculptor....</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Though the raw materials from the pirate island are
    dwindling to an end, at least Flavius was able to save the fleet. We must repel Ramadamses
    before we can advance further. I can only hope that Jupiter has the strength to protect me
    from the gods of my foes....</font></p>

    Because of the limit (100 gold bars) this mission appears to be very hard at first glance.
    However, it is quite easy to win. Forget about the neighboring islands, and crush all of
    military building on the main island. Your infrastructure is almost finished right at the
    beginning, so you can ignore most of the warning messages you receive. Produce gold and
    store it in the storage areas at once. Transport all of your soldiers to your main island.
    Once your fighting strength has reached 65%, you can wipe the weak Ramadamses from the
    face of the earth.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">On one occasion my opponent did not have any
    gold and about 80 soldiers. I attacked him with about 130 soldiers (70% offensive
    strength) and lost only ONE spearman!</font></p>
