    Afterwards, you should gather all of your soldiers at the land bridge to prevent early
    attacks on your territory. Basically, there is hardly any building that still needs to be
    built. However, you should build a storage area for storing gold <b>only</b>. You could
    also need some more Settlers (residences). Once the production of gold is in full swing,
    you may start attacking your opponents. First, you should divide the land by moving
    westward. Then you should start conquering the southern part. The following strategy
    reduces your potential losses to a minimum, and gives you a chance of winning the final
    battle without having to recruit a lot of new soldiers.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Attack military buildings, conquer them, and then destroy
    them. Your opponent's forces must be prevented from reaching the site of a crushed
    building. To do this, surround any attacking soldiers with all your swordsmen. The
    computer-controlled opponents will try to reach a (destroyed) tower before they start
    defending themselves. Therefore, it is quite easy to stop them while they are still trying
    to reach their destination. Keeping this in mind it is quite easy to finish off all towers
    one by one, thereby winning the Roman campaign. (This strategy works almost every time.)</font></p>
